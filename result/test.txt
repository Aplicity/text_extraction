         Section 2.11  Extension of Stated Expiration Date.
                       -----------------------------------

         The Company may request the Bank to extend the Stated  Expiration  Date
of the Letter of Credit for successive  five-year periods. On or before November
15,  2000,  the  Company  shall  request  such an  extension  by  executing  and
delivering  to the Bank a written  request  in the form of  Exhibit  C  attached
hereto (an "Extension")  executed by the Company. On or before November 15, 2005
and on or before  November 15, 2010,  provided the Bank has previously  extended
the stated  Expiration  Date,  the Company  shall  request an  extension in each
instance by executing and  delivering  to the Bank an Extension  executed by the
Company. Upon receipt of an Extension,  the Bank shall then determine whether or
not there is an Event of  Default  as  defined  herein or in any of the  Related
Documents.  If an Event of Default  exists under Section  8.1(a),  (f) or (g) of
this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  or a payment  default  exists under any Related
Document,  the Bank shall not be obligated to extend the Stated  Expiration Date
of the  Letter  of  Credit.  If any  other  Event of  Default  exists  under the
Reimbursement  Agreement or any Related Document, the Bank shall provide written
notice to the  Company  of such Event of Default  and the  Company  shall have a
period of thirty  (30) days after  receipt of said  notice to cure such Event of
Default.  If there is no Event of  Default  or if such Event of Default is cured
within such thirty (30) day period,  the Bank shall extend the Stated Expiration
Date by five (5) years by delivering to the Trustee,  on or before  December 31,
2000 and on or before December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2010, as applicable, an
Extension  Certificate in the form of Annex F to the Letter of Credit.  If there
is an Event of Default that is not cured as provided in this Section 2.11,  then
the Bank will not be obligated to extend the Letter of Credit and the Bank shall
not deliver an Extension  Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.11. Such
failure shall be deemed to be a denial of the Company's extension request.

         Section 2.12  Alternate Letter of Credit.
                       --------------------------

         The  Company  may cause  the  Letter  of  Credit  to be  terminated  by

remarketing  shall  be  owned  by the Bank  and  delivered  to the  Trustee  and
registered  in the Bank's  name or in the name of its  nominee,  pursuant to the
Pledge Agreement.  Such delivery and registration shall constitute a purchase by
the Bank of the Bonds ("Bank  Bonds").  Interest on the Bank Bonds shall be paid
to the Bank from the date of the tender drawing until paid in full or remarketed
in  accordance  with the  provisions of the Indenture at the rate referred to as

demand,  for deposit into the Cash  Collateral  Account,  an amount equal to the
maximum  amount then  available  to be drawn under the Letter of Credit.  If any
Event of Default specified in sections 8.1.(f) or (g) shall have occurred and be
continuing,  (x) the Bank shall give notice to the  Trustee  pursuant to Section
6.02 of the  Indenture  requesting  the Trustee to declare the  principal of all
Bonds then outstanding and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon to be due and
payable and (y) the Company shall pay to the Bank,  immediately  and without any

designated  in Section  9.1.,  for deposit in the Cash  Collateral  Account,  an
amount equal to the maximum  amount then  available to be drawn under the Letter

         Section 8.3.  Additional Rights.
                       -----------------

         The Bank  shall  have the  right,  upon the  happening  of any Event of
Default, in addition to any rights or remedies available to it hereunder,  under
the Deed to Secure Debt and any other  Related  Document,  to exercise all other
rights and remedies available to it by agreement, at law or in equity.

         Section 8.4.  Cash Collateral Account.
                       -----------------------

         (a) Upon the  happening  of any Event of  Default,  in  addition to any
other  rights or remedies  available to it  hereunder,  the Bank may require the
Company  to create  and the  Company  hereby  agrees to create a demand  deposit
account  with the Bank (the  "Cash  Collateral  Account").  The Cash  Collateral
Account  shall be in the name of the  Company,  but under the sole  dominion and
control of the Bank and subject to the terms hereof.

         (b) If requested by the Company and subject to the right of the Bank to
withdraw  funds from the Cash  Collateral  Account as provided  below,  the Bank
will, so long as no Event of Default  referred to Sections  8.1.(a),  (f) or (g)
shall have occurred and be continuing, from time to time invest funds on deposit
in the Cash Collateral Account,  reinvest proceeds of any such investments which
may mature or be sold,  and invest  interest or other income  received  from any
such  investments,  in each case in such Eligible  Securities as the Company may
select and notify to the Bank.  Such proceeds,  interest or income which are not
so invested or  reinvested  in Eligible  Securities  shall,  except as otherwise
provided  in  this  Section,  be  deposited  and  held by the  Bank in the  Cash
Collateral  Account.  Eligible  Securities  from time to time purchased and held
pursuant to this subsection shall be referred to as "Collateral  Securities" and
shall,  for purposes of this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  constitute  part of the
funds held in the Cash Collateral  Account in amounts equal to their  respective
outstanding principal amounts.

         (c) If at any time the Bank  determines that any funds held in the Cash
Collateral  Account are  subject to any right or claim of any Person  other than
the Bank or that the total amount of such funds is less than the maximum  amount
at such time available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit, the Company will,
forthwith  upon demand by the Bank,  pay to the Bank, as additional  funds to be
deposited and held in the Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the excess

                                       -41-


<PAGE>
of (i) such maximum  amount at such time  available to be drawn under the Letter
of Credit  over (ii) the total  amount of funds,  if any,  then held in the Cash
Collateral  Account  which the Bank  determines to be free and clear of any such
right and claim.

         (d) The Company  hereby pledges and  collaterally  assigns to the Bank,
and  grants to the Bank a  security  interest  in,  all  funds  held in the Cash
Collateral Account (including  Collateral  Securities) from time to time and all
proceeds  thereof,  as security for the  Obligations.  Nothing in this  Section,
however,  shall either obligate the Bank to require any funds to be deposited in
the Cash  Collateral  Account  or limit  the  right  of the  Bank,  which it may
exercise at any time and from time to time,  to release to the Company any funds
held in the Cash  Collateral  Account  pursuant to the other  provisions of this
Section.

         (e) The Bank  may,  at any time or from  time to time  after  funds are
either  deposited  in the Cash  Collateral  Account or  invested  in  Collateral
Securities,  after selling, if necessary, any Collateral Securities, apply funds
then held in the Cash Collateral Account to the payment of any amounts,  in such
order as the Bank may  elect,  as shall  have  become  or shall  become  due and
payable by the Company to the Bank under this Reimbursement Agreement; provided,
however,  the Bank  shall not use any such funds to pay any  drawings  under the
Letter of Credit.  The Company  agrees that, to the extent notice of sale of any
Collateral  Securities  shall be required by law, at least five  Business  Days'
notice to the Company of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute  reasonable  notification.
The  Bank  may  adjourn  any  public  or  private  sale  from  time  to  time by
announcement  at the time and place fixed therefor,  and such sale may,  without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it will so adjourned.

         (f) Neither the Company nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through
the Company  shall have any right to withdraw  any of the funds held in the Cash
Collateral  Account,  except as otherwise  provided in subsection  (f) below and
except that upon the  termination of the Letter of Credit in accordance with its
terms and the indefeasible  payment and satisfaction in full of all Obligations,
any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account shall be returned by the Bank
to the Company or paid to whomever may be legally entitled thereto.

         (g)  So  long  as no  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing but subject to the  immediately  preceding  subsection  (b), the Bank
will  release  to the  Company  or at its order  (i)  interest  or other  income
received  on  Collateral  Securities  and  (ii) at the  written  request  of the
Company,  funds held in the Cash  Collateral  Account in an amount up to but not
exceeding  the  excess,  if any  (immediately  prior to the  release of any such
funds),  of (x) the total  amount of funds held in the Cash  Collateral  Account
over (y) the maximum amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit.

                                       -42-


<PAGE>
         (h) The Company  agrees that it will not (i) sell or otherwise  dispose
of any interest in the Cash  Collateral  Account or any funds held  therein,  or
(ii)  create  or  permit  to exist  any Lien  upon or with  respect  to the Cash
Collateral  Account  or  any  funds  held  therein,  except  as  provided  in or
contemplated by this Reimbursement Agreement.

         (i)  The  Bank  shall  exercise  reasonable  care  in the  custody  and
preservation  of any  funds  held in the Cash  Collateral  Account  and shall be
deemed  to have  exercised  such  care  if such  funds  are  accorded  treatment
substantially  equivalent  to that which the Bank accords its own  property,  it
being understood that the Bank shall not have any  responsibility for taking any
necessary  steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any such
funds.

ACCORDINGLY, THE BANK AND THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED BY OR AGAINST THE COMPANY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING
TO, THIS REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE RELATED DOCUMENTS.

                                       -45-

         The Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by  Applicable  Law, to set off and apply any and all

held, and other Indebtedness at any time owing, by the Bank to or for the credit
or  the  account  of the  Company  against  any  and  all  of  the  obligations,

provided  that the failure to give such notice  shall not affect the validity of

officers,  directors,  shareholders,  controlling Persons, employees, agents and
attorneys  (collectively,  "Indemnified  Persons") and to hold such  Indemnified
Persons  harmless  from  and  against,  any and  all  claims,  damages,  losses,
liabilities,  costs or expenses which any Indemnified  Person may incur or which
may be claimed by any Person against any Indemnified Person:

         (a) by reason of any inaccuracy in any material respect,  or any untrue
statement or alleged  untrue  statement of any material  fact,  contained in the
Preliminary  Official  Statement or the Official  Statement or any  amendment or
supplement  thereto,  or by reason of the omission or alleged  omission to state
therein a material fact necessary to make such  statements,  in the light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading;  provided,  however,
that,  in the case of any  action or  proceeding  alleging  an  inaccuracy  in a
material respect, or an untrue statement,  with respect to information  supplied
by and describing the Bank in the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official
Statement (the "Bank Information"),  (i) indemnification by the Company pursuant
to this Section  shall be limited to the costs and  expenses of the  Indemnified
Person  (including  fees and  expenses of Bank's  counsel) of  defending  itself
against such allegation,  (ii) if in any such action or proceeding it is finally
determined  that the Bank  Information  contained  an  inaccuracy  in a material
respect  or an untrue  statement,  then the  Company  shall not be  required  to
indemnify the Indemnified Person for any claims, damages,  losses,  liabilities,
costs or expenses to the extent caused by such  inaccuracy or untrue  statement,
and (iii) if any such action or proceeding  shall be settled by the  Indemnified
Person without there being a final  determination to the effect described in the
preceding  clause  (ii),  then the Company  shall be required to  indemnify  the
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section only if such action or proceeding is
settled with the Company's consent; or

         (b) by reason  of or in  connection  with the  execution,  delivery  or
performance of the Bonds,  the Indenture,  or the Agreement,  or any transaction
contemplated by the Indenture or the Agreement; or

         (c) by  reason  of or in  connection  with  the  lawful  execution  and
delivery or transfer of, or payment or failure to make lawful payment under, the
Letter of Credit;

provided,  however,  that the Company shall not be required to indemnify or hold
- --------   -------
harmless an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section for any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities,  costs or expenses to the extent caused by such Indemnified
Person's  willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence.  Nothing in this Section is
intended to limit the Company's  obligations  contained in Section 2.2.  Without

                                       -47-

Credit.

                       ----------

         Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Reimbursement Agreement,
any consent or approval required or permitted by this Reimbursement Agreement or
in any Related  Document  to be given by the Bank may be given,  and any term of
this Reimbursement  Agreement or of any Related Document may be amended, and the
performance  or  observance  by the  Company of any terms of this  Reimbursement
Agreement or such Related Document or the continuance of any Default or Event of
Default may be waived (either  generally or in a particular  instance and either
retroactively or prospectively)  with, but only with, the written consent of the
Company and the written consent of the Bank. No waiver shall extend to or affect
any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent  thereon.  No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Bank in exercising any
right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial  thereto. No
notice to or demand  upon the  Company  shall  entitle  the  Company to other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

         Section 9.7.  Survival.
                       --------

Indemnified  Persons are entitled under the provisions of Sections 9.2. and 9.5.

Documents,  shall  continue in full force and effect and shall  protect the Bank
and the other Indemnified  Persons against events arising after such termination
as well as before.

                       --------------------------

         To the  greatest  extent  permitted  by  law,  any  provision  of  this
Reimbursement Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall,  as to such  jurisdiction,  be  ineffective  only to the  extent  of such
prohibition  or  unenforceability  without  invalidating  the  remainder of such
provision  or the  remaining  provisions  hereof or  affecting  the  validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

participations  in, or  otherwise  dispose of, all or any portion of its rights,
benefits and/or  obligations  under this  Reimbursement  Agreement and under any
Related  Document to any Person and in the event of any such  disposition by the
Bank,  all  references  herein to the Bank  shall be deemed a  reference  to the
Bank's transferee or participant to the extent of its participation. The Company
hereby consents to the disclosure of financial or other information  received by
the Bank  concerning  the Company to the Bank's  transferee or  participant  (or
prospective  transferees and  participants).  The Company hereby agrees that any
transferee or participant  purchasing a participation in the Bank's rights under
this  Reimbursement  Agreement may exercise all rights of offset,  banker's lien

outstanding  principal  amount of the Pledged Bonds to be released or sold,  and
the Interest Component (as defined in the Letter of Credit) of the Stated Amount
is reinstated in an amount equal to 60-days'  interest on such principal  amount
calculated at the Maximum Rate (as defined in the Letter of Credit) on the basis
of a 365 or 366 day year, as applicable.

         Section 5. Remedies  Upon  Default.  In addition to any right or remedy
                    -----------------------
that the Bank may have  under the  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the other  Related
Documents or otherwise  under  Applicable Law, if an Event of Default shall have
occurred, the Bank may exercise any and all the rights and remedies of a secured
party  under  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code  as in  effect  in  any  applicable
jurisdiction (the "Code") and may otherwise sell, assign, transfer,  endorse and
deliver  the whole or,  from time to time,  any part of the  Pledged  Bonds at a
public or private sale or on any securities  exchange,  for cash, upon credit or
for other  property,  for  immediate or future  delivery,  and for such price or
prices and on such terms as the Bank in its discretion  shall deem  appropriate.
The Bank shall be  authorized at any sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to
restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and
agree  that they are  purchasing  the  Pledged  Bonds for their own  account  in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and upon consummation of
any such sale the Bank  shall have the right to assign,  transfer,  endorse  and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers  thereof the Pledged Bonds so sold.  Each
purchaser  at any sale of Pledged  Bonds shall take and hold the  property  sold
absolutely  free  from any  claim or right on the part of the  Company,  and the
Company  hereby waives (to the fullest extent  permitted by Applicable  Law) all
rights of redemption,  stay and/or appraisal which the Company now has or may at
any time in the future have under any  Applicable  Law now existing or hereafter
enacted. The Company agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required
by Applicable Law, at least ten days' prior written notice to the Company of the
time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to
be made shall constitute reasonable notification,  but notice given in any other
reasonable  manner or at any other reasonable time shall  constitute  reasonable
notification.  At any such sale,  the Pledged  Bonds,  or portion  thereof to be
sold, may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels,  as the Bank
may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition to exercising the
power of sale herein  conferred  upon it, the Bank shall also have the option to
proceed by suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Pledge  Agreement
and sell the Pledged Bonds or any portion thereof pursuant to judgment or decree
of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction.

         Section 6.  Application  of  Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale of the
                     -------------------------
whole or any part of the  Pledged  Bonds shall be applied by the Bank in payment
of any of the  Obligations,  in any order which the Bank may elect.  The Company
shall remain liable and will pay, on demand, any deficiency remaining in respect
of the Obligations.

but for this Pledge Agreement, under the Pledged Bonds; and (f) to carry out the
provisions  of this  Pledge  Agreement  and to take any action and  execute  any
instrument  which the Bank may deem  necessary or advisable  to  accomplish  the
purposes hereof,  and to do all acts and things and execute all documents in the
name of the Company or otherwise,  deemed by the Bank as  necessary,  proper and
convenient in connection with the preservation, perfection or enforcement of its
rights  hereunder.  Nothing herein  contained shall be construed as requiring or
obligating  the Bank to make any  commitment  or to make any  inquiry  as to the
nature or sufficiency  of any payment  received by it, or to present or file any
claim or notice,  or to take any action with respect to the Pledged Bonds or any
part  thereof  or the  moneys  due or to become  due in  respect  thereof or any
property covered thereby, and no action taken by the Bank or omitted to be taken
with  respect to the Pledged  Bonds or any part  thereof  shall give rise to any
defense,  counterclaim  or  offset  in favor of the  Company  or to any claim or
action against the Bank. The power of attorney granted herein is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest.

         Section 8. Further Assurances.  The Company shall, at its sole cost and
                    ------------------
expense,  take all  action  that may be  necessary  or  desirable  in the Bank's
opinion,  or that the Bank  may  request,  so as at all  times to  maintain  the
validity,  perfection,  enforceability  and  priority  of  the  Bank's  security
interest  in the  Pledged  Bonds (if any),  or to enable the Bank to exercise or
enforce  its rights  hereunder,  including  without  limitation,  executing  and
delivering financing statements, pledges, designations, notices and assignments,
in each case in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Bank,  relating to the
creation,  validity,  perfection,  priority  or  continuation  of  the  security
interest granted  hereunder (if any). The Company agrees to take, and authorizes
the Bank to take on the Company's  behalf,  any or all of the following  actions
with respect to any Pledged Bonds as the Bank shall deem reasonably necessary to
perfect the security interest and pledge created hereby or to enable the Bank to
enforce its rights and  remedies  hereunder:  (a) to register in the name of the
Bank any Pledged Bonds in certificated or uncertificated form; (b) to endorse in
the name of the Bank any Pledged Bonds issued in  certificated  form; and (c) by
book  entry or  otherwise,  identify  as  belonging  to the Bank a  quantity  of
securities that  constitutes all or part of the Pledged Bonds  registered in the
name of the Bank.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Company agrees that Pledged

<PAGE>
Bond which is not in certificated  form or is otherwise in book-entry form shall
be held for the account of the Bank. The Company  hereby  authorizes the Bank to
execute and file in all necessary and appropriate  jurisdictions  (as determined
by the Bank) one or more financing or continuation statements in the name of the
Company and to sign the Company's name thereto.  The Company authorizes the Bank
to file any  such  financing  statement,  document  or  instrument  without  the
signature of the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any property
comprising  part of the  Pledged  Bonds  required  to be  delivered  to the Bank
pursuant to this Pledge Agreement shall be accompanied by proper  instruments of
assignment  duly  executed  by the  Company  and by such  other  instruments  or
documents as the Bank or its counsel may request.

         Section 9.  Rights  Cumulative;  Non-Waiver  of Rights.  The rights and
                     -------------------------------------------
remedies  of the  Bank  under  this  Pledge  Agreement  are  cumulative  and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which it would  otherwise  have. No delay or
failure on the part of the Secured  Party in the exercise of any right or remedy
shall operate as a waiver thereof,  no single or partial exercise by the Secured
Party of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or
the  exercise of any other right or remedy and no course of dealing  between the
parties shall operate as a waiver of any right or remedy of the Secured Party.

         Section 10.  Indemnification.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
                      ---------------
the Bank and any corporation controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with,  the Bank  and any  officer,  attorney,  director,  shareholder,  agent or
employee of the Bank or any such  corporation  (each an  "Indemnified  Person"),
harmless  from and against any claim,  loss,  damage,  action,  cause of action,
liability,   cost  and  expense  or  suit  of  any  kind  or  nature  whatsoever
(collectively,  "Losses"), brought against or incurred by an Indemnified Person,
in any manner arising out of or, directly or indirectly, related to or connected
with this Pledge Agreement,  including without  limitation,  the exercise by the
Bank of any of its rights and remedies under this Pledge  Agreement or any other
action  taken by the  Bank  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Pledge  Agreement;
provided,  however, the Company shall not be liable to an Indemnified Person for
any Losses to the extent that such Losses  result from the gross  negligence  or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified  Person. The Company's  obligations under
this section  shall  survive the  termination  of this Pledge  Agreement and the
payment in full of the Obligations.

         Section 11. Continuing  Security Interest.  This Pledge Agreement shall
                     -----------------------------
create a continuing  security  interest in the Pledged Bonds and shall remain in
full force and effect until indefeasible  payment and performance in full of the
Obligations.  The Company and the Bank hereby agree that the  security  interest
created by this Pledge  Agreement in the Pledged  Bonds shall not  terminate and
shall continue and remain in full force and effect  notwithstanding the transfer
to the  Company  or any  Person  designated  by it of all or any  portion of the
Pledged Bonds.

                                  AMENDMENT TO
                              LETTER OF CREDIT AND
                             REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDMENT TO LETTER OF CREDIT AND  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT  (this
"Amendment")  is made and entered  into as of  September  1, 1998 by and between
ABRAMS RIVERSIDE, LLC (the "Company") and NATIONSBANK, N.A. (the "Bank").

                                   WITNESSETH:
                                   ----------

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to an  Indenture  of Trust,  dated as of November 1,
1997 (the  "Indenture"),  between the  Development  Authority of Douglas County,
Georgia (the "Issuer") and AmSouth Bank (the  "Trustee"),  the Issuer has issued
$11,000,000 in aggregate  principal  amount of the Issuer's  Taxable  Industrial
Development  Revenue Bonds  (Abrams  Riverside,  LLC Project),  Series 1997 (the
"Bonds") to provide funds to finance the acquisition, construction and equipping
of a  facility  for the  manufacturing  of store  fixtures,  located  in Douglas
County, Georgia (the "Project"); and

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to a Lease Agreement,  dated as of November 1, 1997,
between  the Issuer and the  Company,  the Issuer has leased the  Project to the
Company; and

         WHEREAS,  the Bank has issued to the  Trustee,  for the  account of the
Company,  an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") to
pay the principal and interest on the Bonds, as the same become due and payable;
and

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to a Letter of Credit and  Reimbursement  Agreement,
dated as of  November  1,  1997 (the  "Reimbursement  Agreement"),  between  the
Company and the Bank, the Company has agreed to pay to the Bank all amounts paid
under the Letter of Credit; and

         WHEREAS,  the Bank and the Company desire to amend a certain  provision
of the Reimbursement Agreement to clarify that the expiration date of the Letter
of Credit may be extended through the maturity date of the Bonds.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100
Dollars  ($10.00)  in hand  paid  this  day by the Bank to the  Company,  and in
consideration  of  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency  of which is hereby  acknowledged  by the Company and the Bank,  the
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

         1.  AMENDMENT  OF SECTION  2.11.  Section  2.11 of the  Reimbursement
             --------------------------- Agreement  is  hereby    deleted   in
its entirety  and replaced by the following:



<PAGE>
                  "(a) The  Company  may  request  the Bank to extend the Stated
         Expiration Date of the Letter of Credit for successive  periods.  On or
         before  November 15, 2000,  the Company shall request such an extension
         by executing and  delivering to the Bank a written  request in the form
         of Exhibit C attached hereto (an "Extension  Request")  executed by the
         Company.  On or before  November  15, 2005,  on or before  November 15,
         2010,  and on or  before  November  15,  2015,  provided  the  Bank has
         previously  extended  the Stated  Expiration  Date,  the Company  shall
         request an extension in each  instance by executing  and  delivering to
         the Bank an Extension Request executed by the Company.

                  (b) Upon receipt of an Extension Request,  the Bank shall then
         determine whether or not there is an Event of Default as defined herein
         or in any of the Related Documents. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER
         SECTION  8.1(A),  (F) OR  (G) OF  THIS  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT,  OR A
         PAYMENT DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER ANY RELATED  DOCUMENT,  THE BANK SHALL NOT
         BE  OBLIGATED  TO EXTEND  THE STATED  EXPIRATION  DATE OF THE LETTER OF
         CREDIT.  If any other Event of Default  exists under the  Reimbursement
         Agreement  or any  Related  Document,  the Bank shall  provide  written
         notice to the Company of such Event of Default  and the  Company  shall
         have a period of thirty (30) days after  receipt of said notice to cure
         such Event of Default.  If any such Event of Default has not been cured
         as provided in this Section  2.11,  then the Bank will not be obligated
         to extend  the  Letter of  Credit,  and the Bank  shall not  deliver an
         Extension Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.11.

                  (c) If there is no Event of  Default or if an Event of Default
         (other than an Event of Default  under  Section  8.1(a),  (f) or (g) of
         this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  or a payment default under any Related
         Document) is cured  within such thirty (30) day period,  the Bank shall
         extend the Stated  Expiration  Date by five (5) years by  delivering to
         the Trustee,  on or before  December  31,  2000,  December 31, 2005 and
         December 31, 2010, as applicable,  an Extension Certificate in the form
         of Annex F to the Letter of Credit; provided,  however, with respect to
         the Extension  Request  delivered to the Bank on or before November 15,
         2015, the Bank shall extend the Stated Expiration Date by six (6) years
         to  November  15,  2018,  by  delivering  to the  Trustee  on or before
         December 31, 2015, an Extension  Certificate  in the form of Annex F to
         the Letter of Credit.  Any failure by the Bank to deliver an  Extension
         Certificate  to the Trustee by December 31, 2005,  December 31, 2010 or
         December  31,  2015  shall be deemed  to be a denial  of the  Company's
         extension request."

        2.  EFFECT. Except as expressly herein amended, the terms and conditions
            ------
of the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Loan Documents remain in full force
and effect.

          THIS GUARANTY, dated as of November 1, 1997, executed and delivered by
Abrams  Properties,  Inc. (the  "Guarantor") in favor of NationsBank,  N.A. (the

$11,000,000  (the  "Bonds")  pursuant to that  certain  Indenture of Trust dated
November 1, 1997 (the "Indenture") among the Issuer and AmSouth Bank, as trustee
(the "Trustee") for the purpose of financing the  acquisition,  construction and
equipping of a manufacturing  facility for the  manufacturing  of store fixtures
located in Douglas County, Georgia (the "Project"); and

         WHEREAS,  in connection with the issuance of the Bonds,  the Issuer and
Abrams  Riverside,  LLC (the  "Lessee")  will  enter  into  that  certain  Lease
Agreement dated as of November 1, 1997 (the "Lease Agreement"),  under which the
Lessee agreed to make payments in an amount  sufficient to pay the principal of,

         WHEREAS,  under the Lease  Agreement,  the  Lessee has agreed to pay as
rental payments  amounts  sufficient to pay the principal and purchase price of,
premium,  if any,  and  interest  on the  Bonds as and when the same are due and

         WHEREAS,  as security for the payment of the Bonds, the Bank will issue
its  direct-pay  irrevocable  letter of credit  in favor of the  Trustee  in the
original stated amount of $11,162,739.72  (the "Letter of Credit"),  pursuant to
that certain Letter of Credit and  Reimbursement  Agreement dated as of November

defined below).




<PAGE>
         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged  by the  Guarantor,  the Guarantor
agrees as follows:

         SECTION  1.   GUARANTY.   The   Guarantor   hereby,   irrevocably   and
                       --------
unconditionally,  guarantees the due and punctual  payment and performance  when
due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise,  of the following
(the following  collectively referred to as the "Guaranteed  Obligations"):  (a)
all Obligations (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement); and (b) any and all
extensions,  renewals,   modifications,   amendments  or  substitutions  of  the
foregoing.

         SECTION 2.  GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND NOT OF COLLECTION. This Guaranty is
                     -----------------------------------------
a guaranty of payment,  and not of  collection,  and a debt of the Guarantor for
its own account. Accordingly, the Bank shall not be obligated or required before
enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantor: (a) to pursue any right or remedy
the Bank may have against the Lessee or any other  guarantor  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations or commence any suit or other  proceeding  against the Lessee or any
other  guarantor of the Guaranteed  Obligations in any court or other  tribunal;
(b) to make any claim in a liquidation  or bankruptcy of the Lessee or any other
guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations;  or (c) to make demand of the Lessee or
any other  guarantor  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or to  enforce or seek to
enforce  or  realize  upon any  collateral  security  held by the Bank which may
secure any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations.  In this  connection,  the Guarantor
hereby waives the right of the Guarantor to require any holder of the Guaranteed
Obligations  to take action  against the Lessee as provided in Official  Code of
Georgia Annotated Section 10-7-24.

         SECTION  3.  GUARANTY  ABSOLUTE.  The  Guarantor  guarantees  that  the
                      ------------------
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
documents evidencing the same, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Bank with respect  thereto.  The liability of the Guarantor  under
this Guaranty shall be absolute and  unconditional  in accordance with its terms
and shall  remain in full force and effect  without  regard to, and shall not be
released,  suspended,  discharged,  terminated  or  otherwise  affected  by, any
circumstance  or  occurrence  whatsoever,  including,  without  limitation,  the
following (whether or not the Guarantor consents thereto or has notice thereof):

         (a) (i) any change in the  amount,  interest  rate or due date or other
term of any  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or (ii) any change in the time,  place or
manner of payment of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations,  or (iii)
any amendment or waiver of, or consent to the departure from or other indulgence
with respect to, the Reimbursement  Agreement, the Related Documents (as defined
in the Reimbursement  Agreement) or any other document or instrument  evidencing
any  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or (iv)  any  renewal,  extension,  addition,  or
supplement  to, or deletion  from,  or any other action or inaction  under or in


                                    - 2 -


<PAGE>
respect of, the  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the Related  Documents  or any other
documents,  instruments or agreements relating to the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any other  instrument  or  agreement  referred  to  therein  or  evidencing  any
Guaranteed Obligations or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (b)  any  lack  of  validity  or  enforceability  of the  Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents, or any other document, instrument or agreement
referred to therein or evidencing any  Guaranteed  Obligations or any assignment
or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (c) any  furnishing  to the  Bank of any  additional  security  for the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any sale,  exchange,  release or  surrender  of, or
realization on, any collateral security for the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (d) any settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
any security  therefor,  or any liability of any other party with respect to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any  subordination of the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations to the payment of any other liability of the Lessee;

         (e)   any   bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,    composition,
adjustment,  dissolution,  liquidation or other like proceeding  relating to the
Guarantor  or the Lessee or any other  Person (as  defined in the  Reimbursement
Agreement),  or any action taken with respect to this Guaranty by any trustee or
receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding;

         (f)  any  nonperfection  of  any  security  interest  or  lien  on any
collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (g) any application of sums paid by the Lessee or any other Person with
respect  to the  liabilities  of the  Lessee  to the  Bank,  regardless  of what
liabilities of the Lessee remain unpaid;

         (h) any defect, limitation or insufficiency in the borrowing power  of
the Lessee or in the exercise thereof;

         (i) any act or failure to act by the Bank  which may  adversely  affect
the  Guarantor's  subrogation  rights,  if any,  against  the  Lessee to recover
payments made under this Guaranty;

         (j) any other circumstance  which might otherwise  constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, the Guarantor.

         SECTION 4. ACTION WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. The Bank may,
                    ---------------------------------------------
at any time and from time to time,  without  the  consent  of, or notice to, the



                                    - 3 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor,  and without discharging the Guarantor from its obligations hereunder
take any and all actions  described  in Section 3 above and may  otherwise:  (a)
amend,  modify,  alter  or  supplement  the  terms  of  any  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  including, but not limited to, extending or shortening the time of
payment  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  increasing,  decreasing  or
otherwise  changing  the  interest  rate or fees  that may  accrue on any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) amend, modify, alter or supplement the Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents or any other document evidencing any Guaranteed
Obligations;  (c) sell,  exchange,  release or  otherwise  deal with all, or any
part,  of any  Collateral;  (d) release any Person  liable in any manner for the
payment or collection of the Guaranteed  Obligations;  (e) exercise,  or refrain
from exercising,  any rights against the Lessee or any other Person  (including,
without limitation, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations);  and (f)
apply  any sum,  by  whomsoever  paid or  however  realized,  to the  Guaranteed
Obligations in such order as the Bank shall elect.

         SECTION 5.  WAIVER.  The Guarantor,  to the fullest extent permitted by
                     ------
law,  hereby  waives  notice of acceptance  hereof or any  presentment,  demand,
protest or notice of any kind, and any other act or thing,  or omission or delay
to do any other act or thing,  which in any manner or to any  extent  might vary
the risk of the  Guarantor or which  otherwise  might  operate to discharge  the
Guarantor from its obligations hereunder;  provided, however, that the Guarantor
shall be provided with copies of all notices delivered to the Lessee pursuant to
Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         SECTION 6.  INABILITY TO ACCELERATE  LOAN. If the Bank or the holder of
                     -----------------------------
any of the Guaranteed Obligations is prevented under Applicable Law or otherwise
from demanding or  accelerating  payment thereof by reason of any automatic stay
or  otherwise,  the Bank or such holder  shall be  entitled to receive  from the
Guarantor,  upon demand  therefor,  the sums which otherwise would have been due
had such demand or acceleration occurred.

         SECTION 7.  REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS.  If claim is ever
                     ----------------------------------------
made upon the Bank for  repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts  received
in  payment or on account  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and the Bank
repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative  body having jurisdiction over the Bank or any of
its property,  or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by
the Bank with any such claimant (including the Lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy
for the Lessee),  then,  and in such event,  the Guarantor  agrees that any such
judgment,  decree,  order,  settlement  or  compromise  shall be  binding on it,
notwithstanding  any revocation  hereof or the cancellation of the Reimbursement
Agreement,  the other Related Documents,  or any other instrument evidencing any
liability of the Lessee,  and the  Guarantor  shall be and remain  liable to the
Bank for the amounts so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount
had never originally been paid to the Bank.

         SECTION 8.  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  The Guarantor hereby forever waives
                     ---------------------
and  releases  any and all  claims or causes of action  the  Guarantor  may have
against the Lessee or any other  Person  arising by reason of any payment by the


                                    - 4 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor to the Bank pursuant to this Guaranty,  whether such claim or cause of
action arises by way of any common-law right of subrogation, by way of any other
applicable law or statutes,  or by way of any written or oral agreement  between
the Guarantor and the Lessee or any other Person.  This waiver of subrogation is
for the benefit of the Lessee and the Bank and the  foregoing  waiver may not be
revoked by the Guarantor without the prior, written consent of Bank.

         SECTION 9.  PAYMENTS  FREE AND CLEAR. All sums payable by the Guarantor
                     ------------------------
hereunder,   whether  of  principal,   interest,  fees,  expenses,  premiums  or
otherwise,  shall  be paid in  full,  without  set-off  or  counterclaim  or any
deduction or withholding  whatsoever (including any withholding tax or liability
imposed  by any  governmental  agency or  authority,  wherever  located,  or any
statute,  rule or  regulation  promulgated  thereby),  and in the event that the
Guarantor is required by such applicable law or by such  governmental  agency or
authority to make any such deduction or withholding,  the Guarantor shall pay to
the Bank such additional amount as will result in the receipt by the Bank of the
full amount payable  hereunder had such deduction or withholding not occurred or
been required.

         SECTION 10.  SET-OFF. The Guarantor authorizes the Bank at any time and
                      -------
from time to time,  without notice to the Guarantor,  which notice the Guarantor
hereby  expressly  waives,  to set off and apply any and all  deposits  (whether
general  or  special,  time or  demand,  provisional  or  final,  including  any
negotiable or  non-negotiable  certificate of deposit now or hereafter issued by
the  Bank to the  Guarantor)  or  other  indebtedness  owing  by the Bank to the
Guarantor,  to the then outstanding Guaranteed Obligations then due and payable.
The Bank may  exercise  this  right of setoff  whether  or not the Bank has made
demand for, or accelerated,  any Guaranteed Obligations.  The rights of the Bank
under this Section are in addition to, and not in limitation or substitution of,
other  rights and  remedies  (including,  but not  limited to,  other  rights of
set-off) that the Bank may have.

         SECTION  11.   SUBORDINATION   OF  THE  LESSEE'S   OBLIGATIONS  TO  THE
                        --------------------------------------------------------
GUARANTORS. As an independent covenant, the Guarantor hereby expressly covenants
- ----------
and agrees  for the  benefit of the Bank that all  obligations  and  liabilities
owing  by  the  Lessee  to the  Guarantor,  if  any  of  whatsoever  description
including,  without  limitation,  all  intercompany  receivables  owing  to  the
Guarantor from the Lessee  ("Junior  Claims") shall be subordinate and junior in
right of payment to all obligations of the Lessee to the Bank under the terms of
the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Related Documents ("Senior Claims").

         If an Event of Default shall occur,  then,  unless and until such Event
of Default  shall have been cured,  waived,  or shall have  ceased to exist,  no
direct  or  indirect  payment  (in  cash,  property,  securities  by  setoff  or
otherwise)  shall be made by the Lessee to the Guarantor on account of or in any
manner in respect of any Junior  Claim and the  Guarantor  shall not  receive or
accept any such direct or indirect payment.


                                    - 5 -


<PAGE>
         In the event of a  Proceeding  (as  hereinafter  defined),  all  Senior
Claims  shall  first be paid in full  before any direct or  indirect  payment or
distribution  (in cash,  property,  securities by setoff or otherwise)  shall be
made to any  Guarantor  on  account of or in any manner in respect of any Junior
Claim. For the purposes of the previous sentence,  "Proceeding" means the Lessee
or the Guarantor  shall  commence a voluntary case  concerning  itself under the
Bankruptcy  Code of 1978,  as  amended  (the  "Bankruptcy  Code")  or any  other
applicable  bankruptcy  laws; or any involuntary  case is commenced  against the
Lessee or the Guarantor;  or a custodian (as defined in the  Bankruptcy  Code or
any other applicable  bankruptcy laws) is appointed for, or takes charge of, all
or any substantial  part of the property of the Lessee or the Guarantor,  or the
Lessee or the Guarantor commences any other proceedings under any reorganization
arrangement,  adjustment of debt, relief of debtor,  dissolution,  insolvency or
liquidation  or similar  law of any  jurisdiction  whether now or  hereafter  in

         SECTION 2.  GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND NOT OF COLLECTION. This Guaranty is
                     -----------------------------------------

hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Bank with respect  thereto.  The liability of the Guarantor  under
this Guaranty shall be absolute and  unconditional  in accordance with its terms

in the Reimbursement  Agreement) or any other document or instrument  evidencing
any  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or (iv)  any  renewal,  extension,  addition,  or
supplement  to, or deletion  from,  or any other action or inaction  under or in


                                    - 2 -

respect of, the  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the Related  Documents  or any other
documents,  instruments or agreements relating to the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any other  instrument  or  agreement  referred  to  therein  or  evidencing  any
Guaranteed Obligations or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (b)  any  lack  of  validity  or  enforceability  of the  Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents, or any other document, instrument or agreement
referred to therein or evidencing any  Guaranteed  Obligations or any assignment
or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (c) any  furnishing  to the  Bank of any  additional  security  for the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any sale,  exchange,  release or  surrender  of, or
realization on, any collateral security for the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (d) any settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
any security  therefor,  or any liability of any other party with respect to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any  subordination of the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations to the payment of any other liability of the Lessee;

         (e)   any   bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,    composition,
adjustment,  dissolution,  liquidation or other like proceeding  relating to the
Guarantor  or the Lessee or any other  Person (as  defined in the  Reimbursement
Agreement),  or any action taken with respect to this Guaranty by any trustee or
receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding;

         (f)  any  nonperfection  of  any  security  interest  or  lien  on any
collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (g) any application of sums paid by the Lessee or any other Person with
respect  to the  liabilities  of the  Lessee  to the  Bank,  regardless  of what
liabilities of the Lessee remain unpaid;

         (h) any defect, limitation or insufficiency in the borrowing power  of
the Lessee or in the exercise thereof;

         (i) any act or failure to act by the Bank  which may  adversely  affect
the  Guarantor's  subrogation  rights,  if any,  against  the  Lessee to recover
payments made under this Guaranty;

         (j) any other circumstance  which might otherwise  constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, the Guarantor.

         SECTION 4. ACTION WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. The Bank may,
                    ---------------------------------------------
at any time and from time to time,  without  the  consent  of, or notice to, the



                                    - 3 -

Guarantor,  and without discharging the Guarantor from its obligations hereunder

payment  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  increasing,  decreasing  or
otherwise  changing  the  interest  rate or fees  that may  accrue on any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) amend, modify, alter or supplement the Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents or any other document evidencing any Guaranteed

Obligations in such order as the Bank shall elect.

         SECTION 5.  WAIVER.  The Guarantor,  to the fullest extent permitted by
                     ------
law,  hereby  waives  notice of acceptance  hereof or any  presentment,  demand,
protest or notice of any kind, and any other act or thing,  or omission or delay
to do any other act or thing,  which in any manner or to any  extent  might vary
the risk of the  Guarantor or which  otherwise  might  operate to discharge  the
Guarantor from its obligations hereunder;  provided, however, that the Guarantor
shall be provided with copies of all notices delivered to the Lessee pursuant to
Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         SECTION 6.  INABILITY TO ACCELERATE  LOAN. If the Bank or the holder of
                     -----------------------------
any of the Guaranteed Obligations is prevented under Applicable Law or otherwise
from demanding or  accelerating  payment thereof by reason of any automatic stay
or  otherwise,  the Bank or such holder  shall be  entitled to receive  from the
Guarantor,  upon demand  therefor,  the sums which otherwise would have been due
had such demand or acceleration occurred.

         SECTION 7.  REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS.  If claim is ever
                     ----------------------------------------
made upon the Bank for  repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts  received
in  payment or on account  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and the Bank
repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative  body having jurisdiction over the Bank or any of
its property,  or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by
the Bank with any such claimant (including the Lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy
for the Lessee),  then,  and in such event,  the Guarantor  agrees that any such
judgment,  decree,  order,  settlement  or  compromise  shall be  binding on it,
notwithstanding  any revocation  hereof or the cancellation of the Reimbursement
Agreement,  the other Related Documents,  or any other instrument evidencing any
liability of the Lessee,  and the  Guarantor  shall be and remain  liable to the
Bank for the amounts so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount
had never originally been paid to the Bank.

         SECTION 8.  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  The Guarantor hereby forever waives
                     ---------------------
and  releases  any and all  claims or causes of action  the  Guarantor  may have
against the Lessee or any other  Person  arising by reason of any payment by the


                                    - 4 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor to the Bank pursuant to this Guaranty,  whether such claim or cause of
action arises by way of any common-law right of subrogation, by way of any other
applicable law or statutes,  or by way of any written or oral agreement  between
the Guarantor and the Lessee or any other Person.  This waiver of subrogation is
for the benefit of the Lessee and the Bank and the  foregoing  waiver may not be
revoked by the Guarantor without the prior, written consent of Bank.

         SECTION 9.  PAYMENTS  FREE AND CLEAR. All sums payable by the Guarantor
                     ------------------------
hereunder,   whether  of  principal,   interest,  fees,  expenses,  premiums  or
otherwise,  shall  be paid in  full,  without  set-off  or  counterclaim  or any
deduction or withholding  whatsoever (including any withholding tax or liability
imposed  by any  governmental  agency or  authority,  wherever  located,  or any
statute,  rule or  regulation  promulgated  thereby),  and in the event that the
Guarantor is required by such applicable law or by such  governmental  agency or
authority to make any such deduction or withholding,  the Guarantor shall pay to
the Bank such additional amount as will result in the receipt by the Bank of the
full amount payable  hereunder had such deduction or withholding not occurred or
been required.

         SECTION 10.  SET-OFF. The Guarantor authorizes the Bank at any time and
                      -------
from time to time,  without notice to the Guarantor,  which notice the Guarantor
hereby  expressly  waives,  to set off and apply any and all  deposits  (whether
general  or  special,  time or  demand,  provisional  or  final,  including  any
negotiable or  non-negotiable  certificate of deposit now or hereafter issued by
the  Bank to the  Guarantor)  or  other  indebtedness  owing  by the Bank to the
Guarantor,  to the then outstanding Guaranteed Obligations then due and payable.
The Bank may  exercise  this  right of setoff  whether  or not the Bank has made
demand for, or accelerated,  any Guaranteed Obligations.  The rights of the Bank
under this Section are in addition to, and not in limitation or substitution of,
other  rights and  remedies  (including,  but not  limited to,  other  rights of
set-off) that the Bank may have.

         SECTION  11.   SUBORDINATION   OF  THE  LESSEE'S   OBLIGATIONS  TO  THE
                        --------------------------------------------------------
GUARANTORS. As an independent covenant, the Guarantor hereby expressly covenants
- ----------
and agrees  for the  benefit of the Bank that all  obligations  and  liabilities
owing  by  the  Lessee  to the  Guarantor,  if  any  of  whatsoever  description
including,  without  limitation,  all  intercompany  receivables  owing  to  the
Guarantor from the Lessee  ("Junior  Claims") shall be subordinate and junior in
right of payment to all obligations of the Lessee to the Bank under the terms of
the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Related Documents ("Senior Claims").

         If an Event of Default shall occur,  then,  unless and until such Event
of Default  shall have been cured,  waived,  or shall have  ceased to exist,  no
direct  or  indirect  payment  (in  cash,  property,  securities  by  setoff  or
otherwise)  shall be made by the Lessee to the Guarantor on account of or in any
manner in respect of any Junior  Claim and the  Guarantor  shall not  receive or
accept any such direct or indirect payment.


                                    - 5 -


<PAGE>
         In the event of a  Proceeding  (as  hereinafter  defined),  all  Senior
Claims  shall  first be paid in full  before any direct or  indirect  payment or
distribution  (in cash,  property,  securities by setoff or otherwise)  shall be
made to any  Guarantor  on  account of or in any manner in respect of any Junior
Claim. For the purposes of the previous sentence,  "Proceeding" means the Lessee
or the Guarantor  shall  commence a voluntary case  concerning  itself under the
Bankruptcy  Code of 1978,  as  amended  (the  "Bankruptcy  Code")  or any  other
applicable  bankruptcy  laws; or any involuntary  case is commenced  against the
Lessee or the Guarantor;  or a custodian (as defined in the  Bankruptcy  Code or
any other applicable  bankruptcy laws) is appointed for, or takes charge of, all
or any substantial  part of the property of the Lessee or the Guarantor,  or the
Lessee or the Guarantor commences any other proceedings under any reorganization
arrangement,  adjustment of debt, relief of debtor,  dissolution,  insolvency or
liquidation  or similar  law of any  jurisdiction  whether now or  hereafter  in
effect  relating  to the  Lessee or the  Guarantor,  or any such  proceeding  is
commenced against the Lessee or the Guarantor, or the Lessee or the Guarantor is
adjudicated  insolvent  or  bankrupt;  or any  order of  relief  or other  order
approving any such case or proceeding is entered; or the Lessee or the Guarantor
suffers any  appointment of any custodian or the like for it or any  substantial
part of its property;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor shall fail to pay,
or shall  state that it is unable to pay,  or shall be unable to pay,  its debts
generally  as they  become  due;  or the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall call a
meeting of its creditors with a view to arranging a composition or adjustment of
its  debts;  or the Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall by any act or failure to act
indicate its consent to, approval of or acquiescence in any of the foregoing; or
any  corporate  action  shall be taken by the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  for the
purpose of effecting any of the foregoing.

         In the event any direct or indirect  payment or distribution is made to
the Guarantor in  contravention of this Section 11, such payment or distribution
shall be  deemed  received  in trust  for the  benefit  of the Bank and shall be
immediately  paid  over to the  Bank  for  application  against  the  Guaranteed
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         The Guarantor  agrees to execute such additional  documents as the Bank
may  reasonably  request to  evidence  the  subordination  provided  for in this
Section 11.

         SECTION  12.  AUTOMATIC   ACCELERATION  IN  CERTAIN  EVENTS.  Upon  the
                       ---------------------------------------------
occurrence of an Event of Default  specified in Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement
Agreement, all Guaranteed Obligations shall automatically become immediately due
and payable by the Guarantor,  without notice or other action on the part of the
Bank,  and regardless of whether  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations by the
Lessee has then been accelerated.  In addition,  if any of the Events of Default
described in Sections 8.1(f) and (g) of the Reimbursement Agreement should occur
with  respect  to  the  Guarantor,   then  the  Guaranteed   Obligations   shall
automatically  become  immediately  due and  payable by the  Guarantor,  without


                                    - 6 -


<PAGE>
notice or other  action  on the part of the  Bank,  and  regardless  of  whether
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Lessee has then been accelerated.

         SECTION 13.  INFORMATION.  The Guarantor assumes all responsibility for
                      -----------
being and  keeping  itself  informed of the  Lessee's  financial  condition  and
assets,  and of all other  circumstances  bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Guaranteed  Obligations  and the nature,  scope and extent of the risks that
the Guarantor  assumes and incurs  hereunder,  and agrees that the Bank will not
have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information  known to it or any of them
regarding such circumstances or risks.

          SECTION 14.  GOVERNING  LAW. This  Guaranty  shall be governed by, and
                       --------------
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of GEORGIA.

         SECTION 15.  JURISDICTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER/OTHER MATTERS.

         (a) EACH OF THE BANK AND THE GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY  WHICH MAY ARISE  UNDER THIS  GUARANTY  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF THE
GUARANTOR AND THE BANK  ESTABLISHED  HEREBY,  WOULD BE BASED UPON  DIFFICULT AND
COMPLEX ISSUES. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE
GUARANTOR  AND THE BANK HEREBY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
OF ANY KIND OR NATURE IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN  ACTION  MAY BE  COMMENCED  BY OR
AGAINST THE  GUARANTOR  ARISING  OUT OF THIS  GUARANTY OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER
CAUSE OR DISPUTE  WHATSOEVER  BETWEEN THE  GUARANTOR AND THE BANK OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE.

         (b) EACH OF THE GUARANTOR AND THE BANK AGREES THAT THE FEDERAL COURT OF
THE NORTHERN  DISTRICT OF GEORGIA OR ANY STATE COURT  LOCATED IN DOUGLAS  COUNTY
SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN THE
GUARANTOR AND THE BANK PERTAINING  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THIS GUARANTY OR TO
ANY MATTER ARISING  HEREFROM.  THE GUARANTOR  EXPRESSLY  SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN
ADVANCE TO SUCH  JURISDICTION  IN ANY  ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  COMMENCED  IN SUCH
COURT.  THE  GUARANTOR  AND THE  BANK  WAIVE  ANY  OBJECTION  THAT IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER  HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY  PROCEEDING  IN ANY SUCH  COURT OR THAT SUCH
PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT  FORUM AND EACH AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM THE SAME.

         (c) THE  GUARANTOR  HEREBY WAIVES  PERSONAL  SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS AND
COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS ISSUED THEREIN, AND AGREES THAT SERVICE OF



                                    - 7 -


<PAGE>
SUCH  SUMMONS AND  COMPLAINT,  OR OTHER  PROCESS OR PAPERS MAY BE MADE BY UNITED
STATES MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID ADDRESSED TO THE GUARANTOR AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH
BELOW ITS SIGNATURE  HERETO.  SHOULD THE GUARANTOR  FAIL TO APPEAR OR ANSWER ANY
SUMMONS,  COMPLAINT,  PROCESS OR PAPERS SO SERVED  WITHIN  THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE
MAILING  THEREOF,  IT SHALL BE DEEMED IN DEFAULT AN ORDER AND/OR JUDGMENT MAY BE
ENTERED AGAINST IT AS PRAYED FOR IN SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS.

         (d) THE CHOICE OF FORUM SET FORTH IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL NOT BE DEEMED
TO PRECLUDE  THE  BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY THE BANK OR THE  ENFORCEMENT  BY THE
BANK  OF  ANY  JUDGMENT   OBTAINED  IN  SUCH  FORUM  IN  ANY  OTHER  APPROPRIATE
JURISDICTION.

         (e) THE GUARANTOR AGREES THAT ALL OF ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS  HEREUNDER
SHALL BE  ABSOLUTE,  UNCONDITIONAL  AND,  FOR THE  PURPOSES  OF MAKING  PAYMENTS
HEREUNDER,  THE  GUARANTOR  HEREBY  WAIVES  ANY  RIGHT  TO  ASSERT  ANY  SETOFF,
COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS-CLAIM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

         (f) THE GUARANTOR  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL OF THE WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION
HAVE BEEN MADE  WILLINGLY,  WITH THE  ADVICE  OF LEGAL  COUNSEL  AND WITH A FULL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.

         SECTION 16.  LOAN ACCOUNTS.  The Bank may  maintain  books and accounts
                     --------------
setting forth the amounts of principal, interest and other sums paid and payable
with  respect  to the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and in the case of any  dispute
relating to any  Guaranteed  Obligation,  the entries in such  account  shall be
binding  upon the  Guarantor  as to the  outstanding  amount of such  Guaranteed
Obligations  and the  amounts  paid and  payable  with  respect  thereto  absent
manifest  error.  The  failure of the Bank to maintain  such books and  accounts
shall  not  in  any  way  relieve  or  discharge  the  Guarantor  of  any of its
obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 17.  WAIVER OF REMEDIES. No delay or failure on the part of the
                      ------------------
Bank in the  exercise of any right or remedy it may have  against the  Guarantor
hereunder  or  otherwise  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  and no single or
partial exercise by the Bank of any such right or remedy shall preclude other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right or remedy.

                      --------------------

                      ----------------------
shall be deemed to include the Bank's successors and assigns (including, but not

Guarantor shall be deemed to include the Guarantor's executors,  administrators,

Dear Shareholders:

         Abrams Industries' 74th year was a period of transition, evaluation and
disappointing  operating  results.  Although  revenues once again grew to record
levels,  the  Company  suffered a net loss in 1999,  a reversal  from the record
earnings  achieved  in the prior two years.  The loss  resulted  primarily  from
greater than  anticipated  costs and challenges of adapting to the Company's new
manufacturing  facility.  Earnings in the prior two years also included gains on
real estate sales,  whereas there were no such sales completed  before April 30,
1999, the fiscal year-end.  The Construction  Segment once again achieved record
revenues and profits. Real Estate operating earnings,  exclusive of asset sales,
and cash flow from owned properties  surged to record levels.  Fiscal 1999 ended
with strong earnings in the fourth quarter.

         For the full fiscal year, consolidated revenues were $188,971,527, 5.8%
above last year's  $178,590,842.  The net loss was $676,031,  or $.23 per share,
compared  to  earnings  in 1998 of  $2,999,478,  or $1.02 per  share.  Per share
figures are based on weighted  average shares  outstanding  of 2,936,356  during
1999 and 2,937,712 during 1998.

OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES BEGAN IN 1925. ABRAMS CONSTRUCTION, INC. OPERATES AS
A GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOCUSING ON BUILDING AND RENOVATING RETAIL STORES, SHOPPING
CENTERS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES,
OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION.

     In an increasingly  competitive  construction  marketplace,  we are pleased
that we were able to achieve record levels of revenues and profits. Construction
revenues grew 9.5% in 1999,  increasing to $160,611,412  from  $146,618,878 last
year.  Gross  profit  increased  by 8.1% to  $8,670,331  in  1999,  compared  to
$8,022,630 in 1998.  Operating  earnings rose at an even faster pace,  expanding
16.5% to $4,084,633 from the year earlier $3,506,217.

     We increased volume with our existing customers,  including Academy Sports,
Borders,  CompUSA,  Garden Ridge,  Kmart,  NationsBank,  Office  Depot,  Service
Merchandise,  Staples,  Stein Mart,  SunTrust  Bank,  The Home  Depot,  Upton's,
Wal-Mart and Ward's. We also built projects for several new customers, including
Bassett,  Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, Mars Music,  Pamida and Urban Retail.
Our broadened  customer base allows us more flexibility  when individual  retail
customers modify growth strategies or change store renovation plans.

     In 1999 we completed  113 projects in 25 states,  striving  throughout  the
year to maintain our reputation of delivering completed projects on schedule.

     Operating   earnings  grew  faster  than   revenues,   the  result  of  our
effectiveness  in employing  our resources  and people  despite  ever-increasing
competitive  forces and a very tight labor  market.  We have been  successful in
retaining an  outstanding  workforce,  adding new  employees  that meet our high
standards of professionalism  and integrity,  while continuing the atmosphere of
trust and teamwork that pervades our Company.

     We acquired new computer  hardware and  software,  as we converted to a new
accounting   system,   and  we  began  the   implementation  of  a  new  project
administration  system. Our ongoing  investments in technology are necessary for
us to continue to increase our effectiveness and efficiency.

     As we enter the new  millennium  we will  endeavor to continue  meeting the
challenge of  profitably  managing  scarce  resources and people while adding to
shareholder value.

OUR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS BEGAN IN 1946. ABRAMS FIXTURE CORPORATION PRODUCES
AND INSTALLS STORE FIXTURES FOR SEVERAL OF THE NATION'S  LEADING  RETAILERS.  IN
ADDITION,  WE  PRODUCE  AND  INSTALL  DISPLAYS  FOR THE  BANKING  INDUSTRY.  ALL
MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS  WERE RELOCATED TO ABRAMS  RIVERSIDE,  OUR NEW 250,000
SQUARE FOOT MANUFACTURING  FACILITY IN LITHIA SPRINGS,  GEORGIA, IN EARLY FISCAL
1999.

     Relocating  any  operating  business is a  challenging  task.  In 1999,  we
actually   relocated  two,  combining  our  formerly  separate  wood  and  metal
operations  in a  unified  manufacturing  facility,  and it  proved to be a much
larger and more costly task than we anticipated. Leaving our two long-time homes
in downtown Atlanta, we moved into our new state-of-the-art facility in suburban
metro-Atlanta  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  1999.  We were not
productively  "settled"  into  operations,  however,  until well into the fourth
fiscal quarter.

     During  the first  two  fiscal  months,  prior to  completion  of the move,
customer  orders  were at very low  levels,  allowing us to focus on packing and
scheduling.  Immediately after we went on-line in the new plant,  however,  with
many unopened "boxes" still lining  production  areas, the volume of orders from
existing customers accelerated  dramatically.  As volume soared, we continued to
meet customer  demand,  including  commencing work on a long-delayed  order, but
many planned  refinements and  modifications  of plant layout were delayed,  and
production  workflow  could not be optimally  scheduled.  Despite steady volume,
numerous  operating  inefficiencies  throughout much of the first three quarters
led to  excessive  labor and  material  costs,  much lower  gross  margins,  and
disappointing operating losses.

     Through the first three quarters of the year,  Abrams  Fixture  Corporation
incurred an operating  loss of just under $2.4 million.  In the fourth  quarter,
however, we achieved operating earnings of $605,702, which reduced the operating
loss for the entire year to $1,760,238. Total annual revenues increased 13.7% to
$17,271,657   from  last  year's   $15,193,653.   Exclusive  of  revenues   from
installation  services,  revenues  from fixture  sales in 1999  actually grew to
$16,100,608,  20.5% above 1998's  $13,364,357.  Because of  increased  labor and
overhead costs in 1999, gross  manufacturing  margin was 15.7%,  slightly better
than half the prior year's 29.2%. By the end of fiscal 1999, however,  the gross
margin showed some improvement.

     We are improving the level of production  completions  without  sacrificing
product  quality.  The new plant has reduced  inefficient  and costly  inventory
handling  through the  elimination of trucking  between  separate metal and wood
shop locations.

     Revenues  in  1999  came  from a  number  of  existing  fixture  customers,
including Aaron Rents, Domino's, John Ryan (NationsBank), Kmart, Sears, Simmons,
Stein Mart,  Stiffel,  Sutton,  The Athlete's Foot Group and The Home Depot. New
customers  included Bassett,  Best Buy, Shaw Industries and U.S. Vision.

     In an effort to address the  decline in our gross  margins,  management  is
focusing on more efficient plant utilization,  optimizing production scheduling,
more  proficient  purchasing,  continuous  employee  training,  and  controlling
overhead  and  expenses.   We  are  directing  marketing  efforts  toward  those
opportunities that best can leverage our high  capacity/high  quality production
capability, as we endeavor to return to profitability.

     OUR REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES BEGAN IN 1960. ABRAMS  PROPERTIES,  INC. ENGAGES
IN  REAL  ESTATE  DEVELOPMENT,  REDEVELOPMENT,   ACQUISITION,  DISPOSITION,  AND
MANAGEMENT OF INCOME-PRODUCING  PROPERTIES,  PRIMARILY SHOPPING CENTERS, AS WELL
AS OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY ACQUIRES OR DEVELOPS PROPERTIES
FOR SALE TO  OTHERS  AND FOR OUR OWN  INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.  ABRAMS  PROPERTIES'
PORTFOLIO  OF   INCOME-PRODUCING   PROPERTIES  ON  APRIL  30,  1999,   CONTAINED
APPROXIMATELY  2.3 MILLION  SQUARE FEET,  IN NINE STATES,  CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN
RETAIL PROPERTIES, TWO OFFICE PROPERTIES AND ONE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY.

     After  several  years  of  strategic  repositioning  through  acquisitions,
dispositions and re-developments, 1999 was devoted to integrating the properties
into our real estate portfolio.  The pause in transactions allowed management to
focus on improving portfolio productivity. The results are  encouraging.

     Cash flow  after  debt  service  from owned  properties  in 1999  increased
$793,000 or 64% over last year, and was 109% higher than the levels of 1995, the
final year before we began the overhaul of the portfolio.  Similarly,  operating
earnings excluding real estate sales and depreciation  surged $1,459,000 or 396%
in 1999, and was $891,000 or 95% above 1995. The return on average cash invested
in real estate tripled in 1999 to 15.06%.

     A key component of our  strategy in recent years has been to use  strategic
sales,  reinvestments and  redevelopments to help diversify the mix of portfolio
revenues and reduce reliance on any single customer. The percentage of portfolio
revenues (total revenues less interest income and gains on sale)  represented by
Kmart,  our largest source of rental  revenue,  was 36% in 1999, a 20% reduction
from last year's figure of 45%, and 36% below 1997's Kmart revenue concentration
of 56%.

     During the year  Merchants  Crossing  Shopping  Center of Newnan,  Georgia,
originally  developed by the Company in 1974 and expanded in 1987 and 1989,  was
marketed  for sale.  Before a sale  transaction  could be  structured,  however,
Goody's  elected to end its  anchor  tenancy  in the  center,  creating a 24,986
square foot vacancy.  While continuing efforts to sell the center, we identified
a suitable  replacement anchor tenant to fill the space. In the closing weeks of
the year, we successfully executed a new lease with Hastings Entertainment, Inc.
Subsequently,  in the first weeks of fiscal 2000, the Company closed on the sale
of the Newnan center for a price of $6.74 million, earning a gross profit on the
sale of $2.9 million.

     In continuation of our strategy to vary the mix of real estate assets,  and
to defer the income tax  otherwise  payable on the gain on sale, in July 1999 we
reinvested  the  proceeds  from the Newnan sale in the  purchase  of  Crossroads
Square Shopping Center in Jacksonville, Florida.

     Effective leasing and a reduction in overall operating costs contributed to
the gains in operating cash flow and operating earnings. Additional increases in
productivity can be achieved by more leasing, effective property management, and
additional cost reductions.

     The  successful  implementation  of our strategic plan is the result of the
leadership,   talents  and  efforts  of  our  team  of  top-notch   real  estate
professionals.  One such executive,  Brennon E. Smith,  Assistant Vice President
and Director of Construction,  earned a promotion to Vice President. We continue
to seek to improve the abilities and productivity of our people.

     As an  additional  vehicle  to grow Real  Estate  cash  flow and  return on
assets,  and in order to expand the  productivity of the Company's cash invested
in real estate, the Company is considering opportunities to work with sources of
outside equity capital.  We continue to seek  diversification  and will look for
other  ways to  improve  investment  returns  as part of our  pursuit  of higher
shareholder value.

     In June 1999, your Board of Directors  declared a dividend in the amount of
$.04 per share, the Company's 80th consecutive quarterly dividend.  The dividend
was paid on June 30, 1999, to shareholders of record as of June 16, 1999.

     The Board of Directors  also decided to commence an in-depth  investigation
of  strategic  and  financial  alternatives  that may be  available  to maximize
shareholder value. That investigation is now underway.

     In July 1999,  Alan R. Abrams,  Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors,  was
promoted to the post of Chief Executive  Officer.  Mr. Abrams succeeds Joseph H.
Rubin,  who is leaving  after  twenty  years of service to the Company to pursue
other  business  interests.  J.  Andrew  Abrams,  Co-Chairman  of the  Board  of
