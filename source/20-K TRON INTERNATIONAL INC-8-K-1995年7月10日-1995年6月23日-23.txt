ITEM 2.          ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

                 On June 23, 1995, K-Tron International, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation ("K-Tron"), through two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, K-Tron
Deutschland GmbH, a German company with limited liability ("K-Tron Germany"),
and K-Tron Holding AG, a Swiss corporation ("K-Tron Holding"), sold to Dr.
Dolemeyer GmbH ("Dolemeyer"), a German company with limited liability, its
94% interest (the "Colortronic Shares") in the outstanding share capital of
Colortronic GmbH, a German company with limited liability ("Colortronic").
Since the remaining 6% of the outstanding Colortronic share capital was owned
by a subsidiary of Colortronic, the effect of the sale of the Colortronic
Shares was to transfer to Dolemeyer control of all of the outstanding
Colortronic share capital.  The disposition of the Colortronic Shares was made
pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 23, 1995 (the "Share
Purchase Agreement"), by and among K-Tron Germany, K-Tron Holding and
Dolemeyer. The Share Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and
incorporated herein by reference.

                 The Colortronic Shares were sold by K-Tron Germany and K-Tron
 Holding for a cash purchase price of $7 million.  At the same time, another
 K-Tron subsidiary, K-Tron Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, sold
 Dolemeyer certain patents and patent applications used in the Colortronic
 business for a cash purchase price of $2 million.

                 Dolemeyer is an investment group which K-Tron has been
advised includes affiliates of Alpinvest III B.V. and ABNAMRO Ventures B.V. as
well as two K-Tron executives, Marcel O. Rohr, president and chief executive
officer, and Martin Schuler, K-Tron's senior vice president - finance for
European operations.  Messrs. Rohr and Schuler resigned from all of their
positions with K-Tron in connection with the sale, such resignations having
been effective on June 30, 1995, and Leo C. Beebe, K-Tron's chairman, has
assumed the duties of chief executive officer.

                 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. acted as financial advisor to K-Tron
in the sale of Colortronic, which was the result of a comprehensive marketing
effort conducted by such firm.


ITEM 5.          OTHER EVENTS.

                 As previously reported, K-Tron is in default under several
financial covenants contained in its loan agreement with three U.S. banks.
These defaults are continuing and have not been waived.  On April 28, 1995,
K-Tron entered into a forbearance agreement with its U.S. banks in which they
agreed to forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the loan
documents through the earlier of July 31, 1995 or the occurrence of a new event
of default thereunder.

                 In connection with the sale of Colortronic, K-Tron entered
into a Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Revolving Credit and Term
Loan Agreement with its U.S. banks (the "Forbearance Agreement"), in which the
banks agreed, in exchange for a $3.45 million payment in permanent reduction of
the loan facility thereunder (from approximately $13.5 million to approximately
$10.0 million), to further extend the period during which they agreed to
forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the loan documents
to the earlier of February 28, 1996 or the occurrence of a new event of default
thereunder.

                 The Forbearance Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1
and incorporated herein by reference.

                   FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT AND THIRD AMENDMENT
                  TO REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT


                 This Forbearance Agreement and Third Amendment to Revolving
Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the "Forbearance Agreement and Third
Amendment") dated June 22, 1995, is by and among K-Tron International, Inc., a
New Jersey corporation ("K-Tron International") and K-Tron America, Inc.
(formerly known as K-Tron North America, Inc.), a Delaware corporation ("K-Tron
America") (each individually, a "Borrower" and collectively, the "Borrowers");
K-Tron Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("K-Tron Technologies"),
K-Tron Investment Co., a Delaware corporation ("K-Tron Investment"), and K-Tron
Patent, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("K-Tron Patent") (each individually a
"Surety" and collectively the "Sureties") (the Borrowers and Sureties are
collectively referred to herein as the "Obligors"); First Fidelity Bank, N.A.
(successor-by-merger to First Fidelity Bank, N.A., New Jersey) ("FFB"), PNC
Bank, N.A. ("PNC"), and United Jersey Bank (successor-by-merger to United
Jersey Bank/South, N.A.)("UJB") (each individually, a "Bank" and collectively,
the "Banks"); and FFB as agent for the Banks (FFB in such capacity, the
"Agent").

                                   BACKGROUND

                 1.       The Borrowers, the Banks and the Agent have entered
into that certain Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated June 28, 1993,
as amended by that certain First Amendment to Loan Agreement dated as of June
30, 1994, and as further amended by that certain Forbearance Agreement and
Second Amendment to Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated April 28,
1995 (the "Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment") (collectively, the
"Existing Loan Agreement").

                 2.       K-Tron Technologies has executed that certain
Suretyship Agreement dated June 28, 1993 in favor of the Agent (the "1993
Suretyship Agreement") pursuant to which the Surety guaranteed and became the
surety for the Guaranteed Obligations (as such term is defined in the 1993
Suretyship Agreement).

                 3.       The Borrowers notified the Banks in December, 1994
that they were projecting certain financial covenant defaults under the
Existing Loan Agreement to occur as of December 31, 1994.

                 4.       Events of Default under the Existing Loan Agreement
have occurred, are now continuing and the Borrowers believe will continue
throughout the Forbearance Period (defined hereafter) under the Existing Loan
Agreement as a result of, inter alia, the Borrowers' failure to comply with
various financial covenants in the Existing Loan Agreement as more fully

                                      1
<PAGE>   2
described on Exhibit 3.1 to the Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment
(collectively, the "Existing Defaults").

                 5.       Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement and Second
Amendment, the Agent and the Banks agreed to forbear from exercising their
rights under the Existing Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, upon the
terms and conditions contained therein, until not later than July 31, 1995.

                 6.       The Term Loan (as such term is defined in the
Existing Loan Agreement) matures on July 31, 1995, and the Obligors believe
that they may not be able to pay the Term Loan in full upon its maturity, which
would cause an additional Event of Default under the Existing Loan Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

                 7.       The Obligors have informed the Banks that they intend
to sell an indirect subsidiary of K-Tron International, Colortronic GmbH
("Colortronic") and certain patents and trademarks currently licensed to
Colortronic and pay a portion of the proceeds of such sale to the Banks.

                 8.       The Agent and the Banks have agreed to continue to
forbear for a limited period of time, from exercising their rights under the
Existing Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents upon the terms and
conditions contained herein.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, incorporating the Background herein, and for
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Borrowers, the
Sureties, the Banks and the Agent, agree as follows:

                          President and Chief Financial Officer



         Cherry Hill, New Jersey -- June 16, 1995 -- K-Tron International, Inc.
(NASDAQ - KTII) today announced that it has agreed to sell its German
subsidiary, Colortronic GmbH, to an investment group for $9 million in cash.
The Colortronic stock sale will also reduce K-Tron's worldwide bank
indebtedness by approximately $14 million.  The closing of the transaction is
subject to the completion of documentation and the satisfaction of certain
conditions but is expected to occur before the end of the month.

         The investment group includes affiliates of Alpinvest III B.V. and
ABNAMRO Ventures B.C. as well as two K-Tron executives, Marcel O. Rohr,
president and chief executive officer, and Martin Schuler, K-Tron's senior vice
president - finance for European operations.  Messrs. Rohr and Schuler will
resign from all of their positions with K-Tron in connection with the sale, and
Leo C.  Beebe, K-Tron's chairman, will assume the duties of chief executive
officer.

         Commenting on the sale, Mr. Beebe said "The divestiture is a major
step in our turnaround program to streamline and focus on our traditional
feeder business where K-Tron has excelled for 30 years.  While K-Tron will
incur a net loss of approximately $10 million on the sale after giving effect
to anticipated future tax benefits, this loss is primarily a non-cash write off
of goodwill which will have no adverse effect on K-Tron's future operations or
cash flow.  Furthermore, the sale will significantly reduce K-Tron's bank debt
and interest expense, simplify its organization and accelerate the company's
goal of returning to profitability in 1995."

         K-Tron International, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is a major
producer of gravimetric and volumetric feeders, blenders and related process
control and material handling equipment, with facilities and customers
throughout the world.
