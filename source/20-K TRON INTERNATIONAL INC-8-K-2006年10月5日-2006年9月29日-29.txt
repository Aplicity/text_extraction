<PAGE>

          2.1 THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. Each Lender severally and not
jointly agrees, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to make
Advances to Borrowers from time to time, as requested by Borrowing Agent or any
Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, up to
a maximum principal amount at any time outstanding equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility Amount. The
Advances shall be evidenced by Borrowers' promissory notes (each, a "REVOLVING
CREDIT NOTE" and collectively, the "REVOLVING CREDIT NOTES") each in form and
substance satisfactory to Lenders.

          2.2 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrowers agree that proceeds of the Revolving
Credit Facility may be used solely to (i) refinance certain existing
Indebtedness of Borrowers to National City Bank and The Bank on the Closing
Date, (ii) provide for future working capital requirements and for other general
corporate purposes of Borrowers, and (iii) fund Permitted Acquisitions.

     3. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

          3.1 ISSUANCE. Agent agrees, for so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists and if requested by Borrowing Agent or any Borrower, to issue its
Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower, provided that, in no event
shall the aggregate amount available to be drawn under issued and outstanding
Letters of Credit (a) exceed $10,000,000, or (b), when combined with the
aggregate of all then outstanding Advances, exceed the Maximum Revolving Credit
Facility Amount.

          3.2 REQUEST FOR LETTER OF CREDIT. Borrowing Agent or any Borrower may
request Agent to issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to Agent the applicable
commercial or standby letter of credit application (the "LETTER OF CREDIT
APPLICATION"), completed to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent and such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information as Agent may reasonably
request.

          3.3 DESCRIPTION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit shall,
among other things, (i) provide for the payment of sight or time drafts when
presented for honor thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof and when
accompanied by the documents described therein and (ii) have an expiration date
occurring not later than the earlier of (a) thirty (30) days prior to the last
day of the Contract Period or (b) twelve (12) months after such Letter of
Credit's date of issuance.

          3.4 REDUCTION OF AVAILABILITY. Availability under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be reduced by the total outstanding undrawn amount of all Letters
of Credit.

          3.5 INDEMNIFICATION. In connection with the issuance of any Letter of
Credit, Borrowers hereby indemnify, save and hold Agent and each Lender harmless
from any loss, cost, expense or liability, including, without limitation,
payments made by Agent and each Lender, and reasonable expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred by Agent and each Lender


                                       14

<PAGE>

arising out of, or in connection with any Letter of Credit to be issued or
created for any Borrower except to the extent any loss, cost, expense or
liability is attributable to Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Borrowers shall be bound by Agent's or any Lender's regulations and
good faith interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued or created for any
Borrower's account, although this interpretation may be different from such
Borrower's own, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be liable for any error,
negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any
Borrower's instructions or those contained in any Letter of Credit or any
modifications, amendments or supplements thereto or in creating or paying any
Letter of Credit, except for Agent's or any Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

          3.6 DISBURSEMENTS. Agent will promptly notify Borrowing Agent of the
presentment for payment under a Letter of Credit, following receipt by it of
such presentment, together with notice of the date such payment was made. All
disbursements under a Letter of Credit shall be deemed irrevocably to be a
request by Borrowers for an Advance on the date such disbursement was made.

          3.7 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse
Agent for disbursements described in SECTION 3.6 shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and regardless of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which any Borrower may have against Agent,
any Lender, or the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (except in the event of
any such party's gross negligence or willful misconduct), including, without
limitation, any defense based upon any draft, demand or certificate or other
document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient, the failure of any disbursement or payment by Agent
under the Letter of Credit ("BANK PAYMENT") to conform to the terms of the
Letter of Credit (if such disbursement or Bank Payment is determined to be
appropriate and other than as a consequence of Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary
of the proceeds of such disbursement or Bank Payment or the legality, validity,
form, regularity or enforceability of the Letter of Credit.

          3.8 LENDER'S REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Lender shall, to the
extent of the percentage amount equal to the product of such Lender's Commitment
Percentage times the aggregate amount of all disbursements made with respect to
Letters of Credit, be deemed to have irrevocably purchased an undivided
participation in each Advance made as a consequence of such disbursement. In the
event that at the time a disbursement is made the unpaid balance of Advances
exceeds or would exceed, with the making of such disbursement, the Maximum
Revolving Credit Facility Amount and the amount in excess thereof is not
reimbursed by Borrowers within two (2) Business Days, Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender and upon Agent's demand each Lender shall pay to Agent such
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed disbursement together with
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of Agent's unreimbursed costs and expenses
relating to such unreimbursed disbursement. Upon receipt by Agent of a repayment
from Borrowers of any amount disbursed by Agent for which Agent had


                                       15

<PAGE>

already been reimbursed by Lenders, Agent shall deliver to each Lender that
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such repayment. Each Lender's participation
commitment with respect to Letters of Credit shall continue until the last to
occur of the following events: (a) Agent ceases to be obligated to issue Letters
of Credit; (b) no Letter of Credit issued hereunder remains outstanding and
uncancelled and (c) all Persons including Agent (other than Borrowers) have been
fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit.

          3.9 CASH COLLATERAL. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation
of any Event of Default, at the option of Agent, Borrowers will pay to Agent,
for the ratable benefit of Lenders, cash in an amount equal to one hundred two
percent (102%) of the undrawn face amount of the Letters of Credit. Such cash
shall be held by Agent in a cash collateral account at Agent, subject to Agent's
sole control (the "CASH COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") and, at such time as no further
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, will be
released to Borrowers to the extent not otherwise applied as provided herein.
Borrowers hereby pledge and grant to Agent a security interest in, all such cash
and other amounts held in the Cash Collateral Account from time to time and all
earnings thereof and Proceeds thereon, as security for the payment of all
Obligations. Agent shall release from the Cash Collateral Account and return to
Borrowers (i) any funds held in the Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal
to one hundred two percent (102%) of any single Letter of Credit as such Letter
of Credit expires and (ii) any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account
upon the satisfaction in full of the Obligations. If at any time, and from time
to time, the aggregate amount of the Cash Collateral Account exceeds one hundred
two percent (102%) of the undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit then
issued and outstanding, Agent shall return any excess to Borrowers.

          3.10 WAIVER OF LIABILITY. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall assume
any risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the
beneficiary thereof. Neither Agent nor any Lender (except in the event of its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct) shall be responsible for:

               (a) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of the Letter of Credit or any document submitted by any party in
connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even
if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient,
inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;

               (b) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to
transfer or assign the Letters of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or
Proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
ineffective for any reason;

               (c) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or
delivery of any messages by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise; or

               (d) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document or draft required in order to make a disbursement.


                                       16

<PAGE>

     None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any of
the rights or powers granted Agent hereunder. In furtherance, and not in
limitation or derogation of any of the foregoing, any action taken or omitted to
be taken by Agent or any Lender with such Letters of Credit made in good faith
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon
Borrowers and shall not put Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, under any
resulting liability therefor.

     4. INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES.

          4.1 INTEREST.

               (a) RATES OF INTEREST. Interest shall accrue on the principal
amount of Prime Rate Loans outstanding at the end of each day (computed on the
actual days elapsed over a year of 365/366 days) at a fluctuating rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin. After the date hereof, the
foregoing rate of interest shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be,
by an amount equal to any increase or decrease in the Prime Rate, with such
adjustments to be effective as of the opening of business on the day that any
such change in the Prime Rate becomes effective. The Prime Rate in effect on the
date hereof shall be the Prime Rate effective as of the opening of business on
the date hereof. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the LIBOR Rate
Loans outstanding at the end of each day (computed on the actual days elapsed
over a year of 360 days) at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate
for the applicable Rate Period plus the Applicable Margin.

               (b) DEFAULT RATE. Interest will accrue on the principal balance
of the Loans (including any principal balance previously accruing interest at a
LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin) after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default at a rate which is two percent (2%) in excess
of the Prime Rate plus the highest Applicable Margin set forth in the pricing
matrix contained in the definition of the term "Applicable Margin" (the "DEFAULT
RATE"). Borrowers acknowledge and agree that the Default Rate is reasonable in
light of the increased risk of collection of the sums due under the Loans after
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and the costs
and expenses of Agent related thereto.

               (c) POST JUDGMENT INTEREST. Any judgment obtained for sums due
hereunder or under the Loan Documents will accrue interest at the applicable
Default Rate set forth above until paid.

               (d) MAXIMUM INTEREST. In no event whatsoever shall the aggregate
of all amounts deemed interest hereunder and charged or collected pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any law
which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable hereto. If any provisions of this Agreement are in contravention of
any such law, such provisions shall be deemed amended to conform thereto.


                                       17

fees and unused commitment fees and collection charges hereunder shall be
calculated daily and, with respect to interest, shall be computed as provided in
SECTION 4.1 above. For the purpose of computing interest hereunder, all items of
payment received by Agent shall be deemed applied by Agent on account of the
Obligations (subject to final payment of such items) on the Business Day Agent
receives such items in immediately available funds.

          4.2 CLOSING FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Agent for its own account (and
not for the benefit of Lenders) a closing fee equal to $62,500, which shall be

               (a) L/C FEE. For each Letter of Credit, Borrowers will pay to
Agent for the pro-rata benefit of Lenders a letter of credit fee (the "L/C FEE")
in an amount equal to (i) the then Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Loans, times
(ii) the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit (regardless of whether any conditions for drawing could then be
met and determined as of the close of business on any date of determination).
L/C Fees shall be (i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears, and (ii) due and
payable on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the end of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C expiration date and thereafter on
demand.

               (b) FRONTING FEE. Borrowers shall pay or reimburse Agent for its
own account, a fronting fee equal to (A) .125% per annum, times (B) the average
aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and
payable on the tenth (10th) Business Day after the end of each March, June,
September and December in respect of the most recently-ended quarterly period
(or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the
first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the L/C
expiration date and thereafter on demand.

               (c) OTHER CUSTOMARY FEES. In addition, Borrowers shall pay or
reimburse Agent for its own account such customary administrative, issuance,
amendment, payment and negotiation charges to be mutually agreed upon by
Borrowers and Agent payable in connection with each Letter of Credit. Such
customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and

rata benefit of the Lender Group an unused commitment fee with respect to the

Agent and Lenders have agreed to increase the Maximum Revolving Credit Facility
Amount to an amount exceeding $50,000,000, and on each anniversary date

     5. LOAN ADMINISTRATION.

          5.1 MANNER OF BORROWING. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility shall be as follows:

               (a) LOAN REQUESTS; PAYMENT.

                    (i) A request for an Advance that is to be a Prime Rate Loan
shall be made, or shall be deemed to be made, in the following manner: (A)
Borrowing Agent or any Borrower may give Agent notice of its intention to
borrow, in which notice Borrowing Agent or Borrower, as applicable, shall
specify to Agent, the amount of the proposed borrowing and the proposed
borrowing date, no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on the requested
borrowing date (which shall be a Business Day); provided however, that no such
request may be made at a time when there exists an Event of Default; and (B) the
becoming due of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement, whether as
interest or for any other Obligation, shall


                                       19

<PAGE>

be deemed irrevocably to be a request by Borrowers for an Advance on the due
date in the amount required to pay such interest or other Obligation. Advances
that are LIBOR Rate Loans shall be requested in accordance with SECTION 5.4;
provided however, in no event may any Borrower request a LIBOR Rate Loan at any
time when a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
As an accommodation to Borrowers, Agent may permit telephonic requests for
Advances and electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements
or reports to Agent by Borrowing Agent or Borrowers. Unless Borrowing Agent
specifically directs Agent in writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or
electronic communications from Borrowing Agent or any Borrower, Agent shall have
no liability to any Borrower for any loss or damage suffered by any Borrower as
a result of Agent's honoring of any requests, execution of any instructions,
authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports communicated to it
telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been sent to Agent by
any Borrower or by Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower and Agent shall
have no duty to verify the origin of any such communication or the authority of
the person sending it.

                    (ii) Each borrowing of Advances shall be advanced according
to the Commitment Percentages of Lenders.

                    (iii) Unless a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, payments shall be applied as designated by Borrowers to Agent
in writing. Otherwise, each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrowers on
account of the principal of and interest on the Advances shall be applied first
to Prime Rate Loans pro rata according to the applicable Commitment Percentages
of Lenders, then to LIBOR Rate Loans pro rata according to the applicable
Commitment Percentages of Lenders. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Agent may discontinue such arrangement and
may apply such funds to costs, indemnities, fees, interest and principal,
constituting Obligations in such order as Agent, in its discretion elects.

                    (iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the immediately preceding clauses (ii) and (iii), commencing with the first
Business Day following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Advances shall be
advanced by Agent and each payment by Borrowers on account of Advances shall be
applied first to those Advances made by Agent. On or before 11:00 A.M.,
Philadelphia time, on each Settlement Date commencing with the first Settlement
Date following the Closing Date, Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments
as follows: (I) if the aggregate amount of new Advances made by Agent during the
preceding Business Day exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments applied to
outstanding Advances during such preceding Business Day, then each Lender shall
provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its Commitment Percentage of the
difference between (w) such Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the
aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Advances during such
Business Day exceeds the aggregate amount of new Advances made during such
Business Day, then Agent shall provide each Lender with its Commitment
Percentage of the difference between (y) such repayments and (z) such Advances.

<PAGE>

                         (B) Each Lender shall be entitled to receive
disbursements of interest from Agent at the applicable rates of interest set
forth herein relating to outstanding Loans which it has funded.

                         (C) Agent shall, on the first Business Day of each
Week, submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and
Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Business Day.

                    (v) If any Lender (a "BENEFITED LENDER") shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon, in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater
proportion than any such payment to any other Lender, if any, in respect of such
other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate
payment is not expressly permitted hereunder, such Benefited Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other
Lender's Loans, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share
the excess payment ratably with each Lender; provided however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each
Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights
of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                    (vi) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone,
confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount
which would constitute its Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to
Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall
make such amount available to Agent and, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Agent will promptly notify
Borrowing Agent of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender. If such amount
is made available to Agent on a date after a Settlement Date, such Lender shall
pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average
Federal Funds Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 365 days) during such
period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii) the number of
days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which such amount
becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph (vi) shall be
conclusive, in the absence of manifest error; provided however, any Lender may,
within three (3) days after its receipt of the same, contest any such
certificate and Agent shall, upon receipt of any such contest, provide such
Lender with supporting documentation relating to the matters contained in such
certificate. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such
Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be
entitled to recover such an amount, with interest thereon at the rate per annum
then applicable to Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrowers; provided
however, that Agent's right to such recovery shall not prejudice or otherwise
adversely affect Borrowers' rights (if any) against such Lender or relieve such
Lender of any obligation it may have to Borrowers.


                                       21

<PAGE>

                    (vii) (A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a
breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available
its portion of any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or any Borrower that it
does not intend to make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual
refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this
Agreement) (each, a "LENDER DEFAULT"), all rights and obligations hereunder of
such Lender (a "DEFAULTING LENDER") as to which a Lender Default is in effect
and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express
provisions of this subsection while such Lender Default remains in effect.

                         (B) Loans shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the
"NON-DEFAULTING LENDERS") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their
respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or
any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall
be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of
principal of any type of Loans shall be applied to reduce the applicable Loans
of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding Loans of that
type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided that, such amount
shall not be applied to any Loans of a Defaulting Lender at any time when, and
to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender
exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage of all Loans then
outstanding.

                         (C) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give
instructions to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any
matters relating to this Agreement and the Loan Documents. All amendments,
waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Loan Documents may be
made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, solely for purposes of the
definition of "Required Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be
a Lender and not to have Loans outstanding.

                         (D) Other than as expressly set forth herein, the
rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to
indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in
this subsection shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its
obligations under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, shall alter such
obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender
hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any other
Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such
Defaulting Lender hereunder.

                         (E) In the event a Defaulting Lender cures to the
satisfaction of Agent and Borrowers all outstanding breaches which caused a
Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be
a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under this Agreement.

          5.2 DISBURSEMENT. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Agent to
disburse the proceeds of each Advance requested, or deemed to be requested as
provided herein by


                                       22

<PAGE>

transferring into the Operating Accounts the amount of the Advance, or otherwise
in accordance with procedures acceptable to Agent.

          5.3 AUTHORIZATION. Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, in
Agent's sole discretion, to advance to each Borrower, and to charge to
Borrowers' Loan Account hereunder as an Advance, a sum sufficient to pay all
interest accrued on the Obligations and all principal coming due on the
Obligations during the immediately preceding month and to pay all costs, fees
and expenses at any time owed by Borrowers to Agent and Lenders hereunder to the
extent such amounts are not paid when due.

          5.4 LIBOR RATE LOANS. Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION
5.1(A)(I) herein, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a LIBOR Rate Loan,
Borrowing Agent or such Borrower shall give Agent prior written irrevocable
notice no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on the 3rd Business Day prior
to the requested borrowing date specifying (i) a Borrower's election to obtain a
LIBOR Rate Loan, (ii) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day), (iii) the amount to be borrowed, which amount shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $250,000 and may increase in integral multiples of
$250,000 and (iv) the applicable Rate Period selected by Borrowing Agent or by
such Borrower. In no event shall Borrowers be permitted to have outstanding at
any one time more than ten (10) LIBOR Rate Loans.

          5.5 CONVERSION OF PRIME RATE LOANS. Provided that no Event of Default
has occurred which is then continuing, any Borrower may, on any Business Day,
convert any Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan. If a Borrower desires to
convert a Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate Loan, such Borrower or Borrowing
Agent on behalf of such Borrower, shall give Agent not less than three (3)
Business Days' prior written notice (prior to 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time on
such Business Day), specifying the date of such conversion, the amount to be
converted and the Rate Period selected by the applicable Borrower with respect
to such converted Prime Rate Loan. Each conversion into or conversion of a LIBOR
Rate Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of $250,000 and may increase in
integral multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof. After giving effect to any
conversion of Prime Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans, Borrowers shall not be
permitted to have outstanding at any one time more than ten (10) LIBOR Rate
Loans.

          5.6 CONTINUATION OF LIBOR RATE LOANS. Borrowers shall have the right
on three (3) Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice given to Agent by
Borrowing Agent, subject to the provisions of SECTION 5.7, to continue any LIBOR
Rate Loan into a subsequent Rate Period of the same or a different permitted
duration, in each case subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

               (a) in the case of a continuation of less than all LIBOR Rate
Loans, the LIBOR Rate Loans continued shall each be in a minimum principal
amount of $250,000 and may increase in integral multiples of $250,000;


                                       23
<PAGE>

               (b) accrued interest on a LIBOR Rate Loan (or portion thereof)
being continued shall be paid by Borrowers at the time of continuation; and

               (c) no LIBOR Rate Loan (or portion thereof) may be continued as a
LIBOR Rate Loan if an Event of Default has occurred which is then continuing or
if, after giving effect to such continuation, Borrowers shall have outstanding
more than ten (10) separate LIBOR Rate Loans in the aggregate.

     If any Borrower or Borrowing Agent on behalf of a Borrower shall fail to
give timely notice of its election to continue any LIBOR Rate Loan or portion
thereof as provided above, or if such continuation shall not be permitted
hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loan or portion thereof, unless such LIBOR Rate Loan
shall be repaid, shall automatically be converted into a Prime Rate Loan at the
end of the Rate Period then in effect with respect to such LIBOR Rate Loan.

          5.7 PREPAYMENT. Subject to the provisions of SECTION 5.8, Borrowers
may prepay any Loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without
premium or penalty; provided that a LIBOR Rate Loan prepaid, continued or
converted other than on the last Business Day of the then current Rate Period
with respect thereto shall be subject to SECTION 5.8 below. Borrowers shall
specify the date of prepayment of Loans which are LIBOR Rate Loans and the
amount of Loans to be prepaid. In the event that any prepayment of a LIBOR Rate
Loan is made on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Rate
Period with respect thereto, Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders
therefor in accordance with SECTION 5.8 hereof.

          5.8 INDEMNIFICATION. Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and
hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses
that Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment
on any date other than the last Business Day of the then current Rate Period or
any default by any Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on
any LIBOR Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a
prepayment of or conversion of or to a LIBOR Rate Loan after notice thereof has
been given, including (but not limited to) any interest payable by Agent or
Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its
LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder, and any other loss or expense incurred by Agent and
Lenders by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by Agent and Lenders to make, continue, convert into or maintain, a
LIBOR Rate Loan.

          5.9 INABILITY TO MAKE LIBOR RATE LOANS. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any
change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it
unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans, or if with
respect to any Rate Period, any Lender is unable to determine the LIBOR Rate
relating thereto prior to such Rate Period, or prior to any Rate Period, adverse
or unusual conditions in, or changes in applicable law relating to, the London
interbank eurodollar market make it, in the reasonable judgment of any Lender,
impracticable to fund therein any of the LIBOR Rate Loans or make the projected
LIBOR Rate unreflective of the


                                       24

<PAGE>

actual costs of funds therefor to any Lender, the obligation of any Lender to
make LIBOR Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith be suspended during the pendency
of such circumstances and each Borrower shall, if any affected LIBOR Rate Loans
are then outstanding, promptly upon written request from any such Lender,
convert such affected LIBOR Rate Loans into Prime Rate Loans at the end of the
then-current Rate Period with respect thereto, or sooner if required by law,
treaty, regulation or directive or the interpretation or application thereof as
herein provided; provided however, in the event any such sooner conversion is
required, no Borrower shall be required to indemnify Agent and Lenders pursuant
to SECTION 5.8 herein with respect to such conversion; but provided further,
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to alter or affect any obligations that
any Borrower may have to any Lender under any interest rate protection
agreement.

          5.10 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR. In the
event that Agent or the Required Lenders shall have determined prior to the
first day of any Rate Period that (a) reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Rate Period, or (b) Dollar deposits in the
principal amount of the relevant Loan and for such Rate Period are generally not
available in the London interbank eurodollar market with respect to a proposed
LIBOR Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Prime Rate Loan into a LIBOR Rate
Loan, Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic
notice of the determination of such effect. If such notice is given, (i) any
such requested LIBOR Rate Loan shall be made as a Prime Rate Loan, unless
Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent no later than 11:00 A.M. Philadelphia time
three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing that the
request for such borrowing shall be canceled or made as an unaffected type of
LIBOR Rate Loan, and (ii) any Prime Rate Loan which was to have been converted
to an affected type of LIBOR Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted into a
Prime Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 11:00
A.M. Philadelphia time three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion,
shall be maintained as an unaffected type of LIBOR Rate Loan. Nothing in this
section shall affect the interest payable on, or the Rate Period in effect with
respect to, any LIBOR Rate Loan during any Rate Period which commenced prior to
the date of such written notice.

          5.11 CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

               (a) DETERMINATION. In the event that Agent or any Lender shall
have determined that any change in, or the introduction, adoption,
effectiveness, interpretation, re-interpretation or phase-in after the date
hereof of any applicable law or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any
change after the date hereof in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency after
the date hereof, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
Agent's or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
a level below that which Agent or any Lender could have achieved but


                                       25

<PAGE>

for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Agent's and
each Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from time to time, upon written demand
not later than thirty (30) days following such Lender's or Agent's making such
determination (which demand shall be accompanied by a certification
demonstrating the calculation of such amounts in reasonable detail) by Agent or
such Lender, Borrowers shall pay to Agent or such Lender such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such reduction as shall
be set forth in such written demand. In determining such amount or amounts,
Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods.
The protection of this section shall be available to Agent or any Lender
regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with
respect to the applicable law or condition.

               (b) CERTIFICATE. A certificate of an officer of Agent or such
Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate
Agent or such Lender pursuant to this section and the calculation thereof and
the reasons therefor when delivered to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

          5.12 INCREASED COSTS. In the event that any change, after the date of
this Agreement, in any applicable law or treaty, or in the interpretation or
application thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other financial, monetary or other regulatory authority after the date hereof,
shall:

               (a) (1)subject Agent or any Lender to any tax with respect to
this Agreement (other than (a) any tax based on or measured by net income or
otherwise in the nature of a net income tax, including, without limitation, any
franchise tax or any similar tax based on capital, net worth or comparable basis
for measurement and (b) any tax collected by a withholding on payments and which
neither is computed by reference to the net income of the payee nor is in the
nature of an advance collection of a tax based on or measured by the net income
of the payee) or (2) change the basis of taxation of payments to Agent or any
Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder or
under any Loan Documents (other than in respect of (a) any tax based on or
measured by net income or otherwise in the nature of a net income tax,
including, without limitation, any franchise tax or any similar tax based on
capital, net worth or comparable basis for measurement and (b) any tax collected
by a withholding on payments and which neither is computed by reference to the
net income of the payee nor is in the nature of an advance collection of a tax
based on or measured by the net income of the payee);

               (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve (except any
reserve taken into account in the determination of the applicable LIBOR Rate),
special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit
extended by, any office of Agent or any Lender, including (without limitation)
pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System; or


                                       26

<PAGE>

               (c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank
eurodollar market any other condition with respect to any Loan Document;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any
Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Loans hereunder by an amount that
Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Loans by
an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in any such
case, Borrowers shall pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand and
certification not later than thirty (30) days following its receipt of written
notice of the imposition of such increased costs, such additional amount as will
compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as
the case may be, to the extent Agent or such Lender has not otherwise been
compensated, with respect to a particular Loan, for such increased cost as a
result of an increase in the Prime Rate or LIBOR Rate. An officer of Agent or
such Lender shall determine the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount
using reasonable averaging and attribution methods and shall certify the amount
of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowers, which certification
shall include a written explanation of such additional cost or reduction to
Borrowers and the calculation thereof. Such certification shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.

     6. PAYMENTS.

          6.1 INTEREST PAYMENTS. Borrowers will pay to Agent (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of Prime Rate Loans on the
tenth (10th) day of each calendar month, commencing on November 10, 2006 and on
the expiration of the Contract Period. Borrowers will pay (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of LIBOR Rate Loans on the
last day of each Rate Period; provided that, for any LIBOR Rate Loan with a Rate
Period in excess of three (3) months, Borrowers will pay (for the pro rata
benefit of Lenders) interest on the principal balance of such LIBOR Rate Loan on
the three (3) month anniversary of the extension of such LIBOR Rate Loan and on
the last day of the applicable Rate Period.

          6.2 PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. Principal payable on account of Advances shall
be payable by Borrowers to Agent immediately upon the earliest of (a) the
occurrence of an Event of Default in consequence of which Agent accelerates the
maturity and payment of the Obligations as expressly permitted hereunder, or (b)
the expiration of the Contract Period.

          6.3 PAYMENT METHOD. Borrowers irrevocably authorize Agent to debit all
payments required to be made by Borrowers hereunder, under the Loans or under
any of the Loan Documents, on the date due, from any deposit or checking account
maintained by any Borrower with Agent (including without limitation, the
Operating Accounts). If there are insufficient funds in such accounts, or Agent
for any reason does not debit such accounts and provides notice of such intent
not to debit such accounts to Borrowers two (2) Business Days in advance,
Borrowers will make such payments directly to Agent at the offices of Agent
located at 2001 Market Street, Suite 600, Philadelphia, PA 19103, or such other
place as Agent may from time to time specify in writing. All payments are to be
made in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or setoff and free and
clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any taxes or other
payments. If Agent accepts payment in any other form, such payment


                                       27

<PAGE>

shall not be deemed to have been made until the funds comprising such payment
have actually been received by or made available to Agent.

          6.4 MAINTENANCE OF LOAN ACCOUNTS; STATEMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS. Agent
shall maintain an account on its books in the name of Borrowers (a "LOAN
ACCOUNT") on which the applicable Borrowers will be charged with all Loans to
such Borrowers or for such Borrowers' account, including, accrued interest,
Lender Group Expenses, and any other Obligations of Borrowers. Agent shall
render statements regarding the Loan Account to Borrowing Agent, including
principal, interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges and
expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses owing, and such statements shall be
conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate, and shall constitute an
account stated between Borrowers and the Lender Group, subject only to manifest
error, unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by Borrowing Agent,
Borrowing Agent shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing the
error or errors contained in any such statements.

     7. COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES.

          7.1 GENERAL. Borrowers will collect their Accounts only in the
ordinary course of business. All Account collections of Borrowers will be
deposited in one or more operating account(s) maintained by Borrowers at Agent
(the "OPERATING ACCOUNTS"); provided, however, that Borrowers shall be entitled
to maintain their existing operating accounts, if any, for a period of six (6)
months from the Closing Date.

          7.2 REMITTANCE OF ITEMS; ENDORSEMENTS. Following the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, immediately upon receipt of any
notes, instruments or chattel paper, each Borrower, and such other persons shall
remit the same or cause the same to be remitted, in kind, to Agent. Each
Borrower shall, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, deliver or cause to be delivered to Agent, with appropriate
endorsement and assignment to Agent with full recourse to Borrowers, all
instruments, notes and chattel paper constituting an Account or proceeds
thereof. Agent is hereby authorized, following the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, to open all mail addressed to any Borrower
and endorse all checks, drafts or other items for payment on behalf of any
Borrower. Agent (and Agent's officers, employees and agents) are granted a power
of attorney by each Borrower with full power of substitution to execute,
following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, on
behalf of each Borrower and in any Borrower's name or to endorse any Borrower's
name on any check, draft, Instrument, note or other item of payment or to take
any other action or sign any document in order to effectuate the foregoing. Such
power of attorney being coupled with an interest is irrevocable.

     8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. In order to induce the Lender Group to
enter into this Agreement, Borrowers, jointly and severally, make the following
representations and warranties which shall be true, correct, and complete in all
respects as of the date hereof, and shall be true, correct, and complete in all
respects as of the Closing Date, and at


                                       28

<PAGE>

and as of the date of the making or entering into each Advance or Letter of
Credit, thereafter, as though made on and as of the date of such Advance or
Letter of Credit (except to the extent that such representations and warranties
relate solely to an earlier date) and such representations and warranties shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

          8.1 VALID ORGANIZATION, GOOD STANDING AND QUALIFICATION.

               (a) Each Borrower is a corporation or limited liability company
duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (or, as to foreign
Subsidiaries, comparable status), as set forth on SCHEDULE 8.1, has full power
and authority to execute, deliver and comply with the Loan Documents, and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or
qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company in good standing
under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which the character or location of
the properties owned by it or the business transacted by it requires such
licensing or qualification, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

               (b) Each of Borrowers' Subsidiaries is a corporation or limited
liability company duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (or,
as to foreign Subsidiaries, comparable status), as set forth on SCHEDULE 8.1,
has full power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified as a foreign corporation or limited
liability company in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in
which the character or location of the properties owned by it or the business
transacted by it requires such licensing or qualification, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified could not reasonably be expected to cause
a Material Adverse Change.

          8.2 LICENSES. Each Borrower and each of its employees, servants and
agents have all licenses, registrations, approvals and other authority as may be
necessary to enable them to own and operate their business and perform all
services and business which they have agreed to perform in any state,
municipality or other jurisdiction, except where the failure to maintain such
licenses, registrations, approvals or other authority could not reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

          8.3 OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. As of the date hereof, the ownership of all
stock, options, warrants and other equity securities of each Borrower (other
than KTI) and all pledges, proxies, voting trusts, powers of attorney and other
agreements affecting the ownership or voting rights of said interests is as set
forth on SCHEDULE 8.3 attached hereto.

may be bound or affected, or any judgment or order of any court or governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or

          8.9 ENFORCEABILITY. The Loan Documents have been duly executed by
Borrowers and delivered to Agent and constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of Borrowers, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

          8.10 NO DEFAULT UNDER OTHER OBLIGATIONS, ORDERS OR GOVERNMENTAL
REGULATIONS. No Borrower is in violation of its Certificates or Articles of
Incorporation or Formation or in default in the performance or observance of any
of its obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any indenture or other
agreement creating, evidencing or securing any Indebtedness or pursuant to which
any such Indebtedness is issued, except where such violation could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change. No Borrower is in
violation of or in default under any other agreement or instrument or any
judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation, applicable to
it or by which its properties may be bound or affected, except where such
violation or default could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material
Adverse Change.

          8.11 GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. No consent, approval or authorization of
or designation, declaration or filing with or notice to any governmental
authority on the part of any Borrower is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by any Borrower of the Loan Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, except for filings
required under the Exchange Act.

          8.12 TAXES. Borrowers' FEINs are as set forth on SCHEDULE 8.12. As of
the date hereof, each Borrower has filed all tax returns which it was required
to file prior to the date hereof and has paid, or made provision for the payment
of, all taxes which have or may have become due pursuant to such returns or
reasonably expected to be paid pursuant to any assessment received by it. Such
tax returns are complete and accurate in all material respects and no Borrower
knows of any proposed additional assessment or basis for any assessment of
additional taxes.

          8.13 NAMES AND ADDRESSES. During the past five (5) years, no Borrower
has been known by any names (including trade names) other than those set forth
in SCHEDULE 8.13 attached hereto and its chief executive office has not been
located at any addresses other than those set forth on SCHEDULE 8.13 attached
hereto. SCHEDULE 8.13 identifies the chief executive offices of each Borrower.

          8.14 CURRENT COMPLIANCE. Each Borrower is currently in compliance with
all of the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.

          8.15 PENSION AND BENEFIT PLANS.

               (a) Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 8.15 hereto, (a) no Borrower
has any obligations with respect to any Pension Plan, (b) no ERISA Events,
including, without limitation, any "Reportable Event" or "Prohibited
Transaction" (as those terms are defined under ERISA), have occurred in
connection with any Pension Plan of any Borrower which might


                                       31

<PAGE>

constitute grounds for the termination of any Pension Plan by the PBGC or for
the appointment by any United States District Court of a trustee to administer
any such Pension Plan, (c) all of Borrowers' Pension Plans meet with the minimum
funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA, if applicable, and (d) no Borrower
has any existing liability to the PBGC. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 8.15
hereto, no Borrower is subject to or bound to make contributions to any
Multi-Employer Plan.

               (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
any of the Pension Plans (other than a Multi-Employer Plan), determined as of
the end of such Plan's most recently ended plan year on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plan's most recent
actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the
assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term "benefits
liabilities" has the meaning specified in Section 4001 of ERISA and the terms
"current value" and "present value" have the meanings specified in Section 3 of
ERISA. No Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliates have incurred withdrawal liability
(and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liability) under Section 4201 or
4204 of ERISA.

          8.16 LEASES AND CONTRACTS. Each Borrower has complied with the
provisions of all leases, contracts or commitments of any kind (such as
employment agreements, collective bargaining agreements, powers of attorney,
distribution agreements, patent license agreements, contracts for future
purchase or delivery of goods or rendering of services, bonus, pension and
retirement plans or accrued vacation pay, insurance and welfare agreements) to
which any Borrower is a party and is not in default thereunder, except where
such failure to comply or default could not reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change. To the best of each Borrower's knowledge, no other
party is in default under any such leases, contracts or other commitments and no
event has occurred which, but for the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both, would constitute an event of default thereunder, except where such default
or potential event of default could not reasonably be expected to cause a
Material Adverse Change.

          8.17 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Each Borrower, to the best of its
knowledge, owns or possesses the right to use all of the patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses, franchises and permits (which
for the purposes hereof, shall be deemed to exclude professional licenses and
permits) and rights with respect to the foregoing necessary to own and operate
such Borrower's properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and presently planned to be conducted without conflict with the rights of
others, except where the failure to own or possess such rights could not
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.

          8.18 BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS. Within five (5) years prior to the date
hereof, neither the business nor operations of any Borrower has been materially
and adversely affected in any way by any casualty, strike, lockout, combination
of workers, order of the United States of America, or any state or local
government, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, directed against any
Borrower. As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the best of each


                                       32

<PAGE>

Borrower's knowledge, threatened labor disputes, strikes, lockouts or similar
occurrences or grievances against the business being operated by any Borrower.

          8.19 ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. No representation or
warranty by any Borrower contained herein or in any certificate or other
document furnished by any Borrower pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
fails to contain any statement of material fact necessary to make such
representation or warranty not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which it was made. As of the date hereof, there is no material fact which any
Borrower knows and has not disclosed to Agent, which does or may materially and
adversely affect any Borrower or any of its or their operations taken as a
whole.

          8.20 SOLVENCY. As of the date hereof, each Borrower is Solvent. No
transfer of property is being made by any Borrower and no obligation is being
incurred by any Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with the intent to hinder, delay, or
defraud either present or future creditors of any Borrower.

          8.21 COMMON ENTERPRISE. The successful operation and condition of each
Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the functions
of all of the Borrowers as a whole. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit (and
its board of directors has determined that it may reasonably be expected to
derive benefit), directly and indirectly, from successful operations of its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit (and the
boards of directors of each Borrower have determined that they may reasonably be
expected to derive benefit), directly and indirectly, from the credit extended
by Lenders hereunder, both in their separate capacities and as members with the
other Borrowers of an interrelated group of companies. Each Borrower has
determined that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
any other Loan Documents to be executed by it as a Borrower is within its
corporate purposes and will be of direct and indirect benefit to such Borrower
and is in its best interest.

     9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. Each Borrower, jointly and severally, covenants
and agrees that, so long as any Lender has any commitment to lend hereunder and
until full and final payment of the Obligations, and unless Agent shall
otherwise consent in writing, each Borrower shall comply with the following:

          9.1 PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE. Borrowers
will pay when due all Obligations without setoff, deduction or counterclaim.

          9.2 CLAIMS FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS. Each Borrower will pay or cause to
be paid when due all taxes, assessments, governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or its income, profits, payroll or any property belonging to it
including without limitation all withholding taxes and all claims for labor,
materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon any
of its properties or assets, except to the extent that such a failure to pay or
cause to be paid would not constitute an Event of Default under SECTION 17.1(D)
of this Agreement and except and to the extent any such amounts are being
actively contested in


                                       33

<PAGE>

good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain adequate
reserves on their books therefor.

          9.3 EXISTENCE; APPROVALS; QUALIFICATION; BUSINESS OPERATIONS;
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Borrower will, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries
formed in the United States and the first tier foreign Subsidiaries to obtain,
preserve and keep in full force and effect its separate corporate or limited
liability company existence, except as otherwise permitted by SECTION 10.5 of
this Agreement. Each Borrower will, and will cause all of its Subsidiaries
formed in the United States and the first tier foreign Subsidiaries to (as
applicable): (a) obtain, preserve and keep in full force and effect all rights,
franchises, permits, licenses, registrations and franchises necessary to the
proper conduct of their business or affairs, (b) qualify and remain qualified as
a foreign corporation or limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of the properties owned by it or the business
transacted by them requires such qualification, (c) continue to operate its
business as presently operated and maintain in full force and effect all
licenses and other qualifications to do business as shall be required to do so,
and (d) comply with the requirements of all applicable laws and all rules,
regulations (including without limitation environmental statutes and
regulations, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Americans With Disabilities
Act) and orders of regulatory agencies and authorities having jurisdiction over
it; all except where any such failure could not reasonably be expected to cause
a Material Adverse Change.

          9.4 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Each Borrower will maintain, preserve,
protect and keep or cause to be maintained, preserved, protected and kept its
real and personal property used or useful in the conduct of its business in good
working order and condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and will pay and
discharge when due the cost of repairs to and maintenance of the same.

          9.5 INSURANCE.

               (a) At their expense, Borrowers shall keep their property insured
against loss or damage by fire, theft, explosion, sprinklers, and all other
hazards and risks, as are ordinarily insured against by other owners in similar
businesses, in amounts and with such companies as are reasonably acceptable to
Agent, but in any event in amounts sufficient to prevent Borrowers from becoming
a co-insurer under such policies and in addition, will carry business
interruption insurance in such amounts as may be reasonably required by Agent.
Any material decrease of any insurance policy or coverage requested by any
Borrower must be approved by Agent in writing prior to the effective date of
such modification.

               (b) Borrowers shall cause to be delivered to Agent the insurance
policies and all endorsements thereto and evidence of insurance utilizing a
current ACORD 27 Evidence of Property Insurance as of the Closing Date.

               (c) Borrowers shall bear the full risk of loss from any loss of
any nature whatsoever with respect to their property.

          9.6 INSPECTIONS; EXAMINATIONS.

               (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all
accountants and auditors employed by any Borrower to exhibit and deliver to
Agent copies of any and all of Borrowers' financial statements, trial balances
or other accounting records of any sort in the accountant's or auditor's
possession and copies of all reports submitted to Borrowers by such accountants
or auditors, including management letters, "comment" letters and audit reports,
and to disclose to Agent any information they may have concerning any Borrower's
financial status and business operations, as to each and every one of which
actions each Borrower hereby expressly consents. After the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, each Borrower further authorizes all
federal, state and municipal authorities to furnish to Agent copies of reports
or examinations relating to any Borrower, whether made by a Borrower or
otherwise.

               (b) If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred which is
then continuing, (i) the officers of Agent, or such Persons as Agent may
designate, may visit and inspect any of the properties of any Borrower, examine
(either by Agent's employees or by independent accountants) any of the assets of
Borrowers, including the Books of Borrowers, and discuss the affairs, finances
and accounts of Borrowers with their officers and with their independent
accountants at such times as Agent may desire; and (ii) Agent may conduct, at
any time and from time to time, and Borrowers will fully cooperate with, a field
examination of the Accounts and business affairs of Borrowers. Provided that no
Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing, such visits,
inspections and field examinations shall be at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice by Agent. If a Default or an Event of Default has occurred
which is then continuing, Borrowers will pay all costs and expenses of Agent
related to such visits, inspections and field examinations.

          9.7 PENSION PLANS. Each Borrower will (a) keep in full force and
effect any and all Pension Plans which are presently in existence or may, from
time to time, come into existence under ERISA, unless such Pension Plans can be

termination (as distinguished from any continuing funding obligation); (b) make
contributions to all of each Borrower's Pension Plans in a timely manner and in
a sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of ERISA; (c) comply with
all material requirements of ERISA which relate to such Pension Plans so as to
preclude the occurrence of any Reportable Event, Prohibited Transaction or
material "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in ERISA; and
(d) notify Agent immediately upon receipt by any Borrower of any notice of the
institution of any proceeding or other action which may result in the
termination of any Pension Plan and deliver to Agent, promptly after the filing
or receipt thereof, copies of all reports or notices which any Borrower files or

U.S. Department of Labor with respect to any Pension Plan.

respects to all Obligations and will not make any payments thereon, except as
approved by Agent in writing.

          9.11 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS AND FUTURE ACTIONS. Each Borrower will, at
its sole cost, take such actions and provide Agent from time to time with such
agreements, documents or information as Agent may in its reasonable discretion
deem necessary or advisable to carry out the terms of the Loan Documents.

          9.12 TAXES. Each Borrower will cause all material assessments and
taxes, whether real, personal, or otherwise, due or payable by, or imposed,
levied, or assessed against any Borrower or any of its property to be paid in
full, before delinquency or before the expiration of any extension period,
except and to the extent any such amounts are being actively contested in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain adequate reserves on
their books therefor. Each Borrower shall make due and timely payment or deposit
of all such material federal, state, and local taxes, assessments, or
contributions required of it by law, and will execute and deliver to Agent, on
demand, appropriate certificates attesting to the payment thereof or deposit
with respect thereto, except and to the extent any such amounts are being
actively contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers
maintain adequate reserves on their books therefor. Each Borrower will make
timely payment or deposit of all material tax payments and withholding taxes
required of it by applicable laws, including those laws concerning F.I.C.A.,
F.U.T.A., state disability, and local, state, and federal income taxes, and

and except and to the extent any such amounts are being actively contested in
good faith and by appropriate proceedings and Borrowers maintain reasonable
reserves on their books therefor.

<PAGE>

          9.14 NOTICES. Borrowing Agent will promptly notify Agent of (a) any

<PAGE>

          13.1 REPRESENTATIONS. Each Borrower represents as follows: (a) the
Environmental Affiliates are in material compliance with all Environmental
Requirements and no Borrower has any knowledge of any circumstances which may
prevent or interfere with such material compliance in the future; (b) the
Environmental Affiliates have or are in the process of obtaining all material
licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations required under applicable
Environmental Requirements; (c) there are no pending or threatened claims
against any of the Environmental Affiliates or any of their assets related to
the failure to comply with any Environmental Requirements which could result in
a Material Adverse Change, or any facts or circumstances which could give rise
to such a claim; (d) no facility or property now or previously owned, operated
or leased by any Environmental Affiliate is an Environmental Cleanup Site; (e)
no Environmental Affiliate has treated, stored, transported, handled or disposed
of Special Materials at any Environmental Cleanup Site in violation of the

(f) there are no liens or claims for cost reimbursement outstanding or
threatened against any Environmental Affiliate or any of their assets which
could result in a Material Adverse Change, or to the best of each Borrower's
knowledge, any facts or circumstances which could give rise to such a lien or
claim.

          13.2 REAL PROPERTY. Each Borrower warrants and represents that there
are no Special Materials presently located on or near any real property owned,
leased or operated by any Environmental Affiliate (collectively, "REAL
PROPERTY") except for Special Materials which are and have at all times been
treated, stored, transported, handled, and disposed of in material compliance
with all Environmental Requirements. Each Borrower represents to Lenders that to
the best of each Borrower's knowledge, the Real Property is not now being used
nor, to the best of each Borrower's knowledge, has it ever been used in the past
for activities involving Special Materials, including but not limited to the
use, generation, collection, storage, treatment, or disposal of any Special
Materials except for Special Materials which are and have at all times been
treated, stored, transported, handled and disposed of in material compliance

(including solid waste such as sludge), except with respect to such solid waste
to be stored or processed for recycling and/or beneficial reuse, in material
compliance with Environmental Requirements.

          13.3 COVENANT REGARDING COMPLIANCE. Each Borrower shall take or cause
all Environmental Affiliates to take, at Borrower's and such Environmental
Affiliate's sole expense, such actions as may be necessary to materially comply
with all Environmental Requirements. If any Environmental Affiliate shall fail
to take such action or fail to assert a defense to an allegation by a
governmental agency that a Borrower and/or an Environmental Affiliate has
violated an Environmental Requirement, and such failure may reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change in Borrower's operations, Lender
may make advances or payments towards performance or satisfaction of the same
but shall be under no obligation to do so. All sums so advanced or paid,
including all sums advanced or paid by Lender in connection with any


                                       44

<PAGE>

judicial or administrative investigation or proceeding relating thereto,
including, without limitation, attorney's fees, fines, or other penalty
payments, shall be at once repayable by Borrowers and all sums so advanced or
paid shall become a part of the Lender Indebtedness.

     The Environmental Affiliates will maintain all material licenses, permits,
approvals and authorizations required under applicable Environmental
Requirements.

          13.4 NOTICES. In the event any Borrower becomes aware of any past,
present or future facts or circumstances not identified on SCHEDULE 13, which
have given rise or could give rise to a claim against any Environmental

Borrowers will promptly give Lender notice thereof, together with a written
statement of an officer of Borrowers setting forth the details thereof and the
action with respect thereto taken or proposed to be taken by the Environmental
Affiliates.

          13.5 INDEMNITY. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold

Agent or the Lender Group, for all loss, liability, damage, cost and expenses,
including, without limitation, attorney's fees and disbursements (including the
reasonable allocated cost of in-house counsel and staff) arising from or related
to (a) the release of any Special Materials in violation of the Environmental
Requirements at any facility at any time owned, leased or operated by any
Borrower or any Environmental Affiliate, (b) the release of any Special
Materials in violation of the Environmental Requirements treated, stored,
transported, handled, generated or disposed of by or on behalf of any Borrower
or any Environmental Affiliate at any third party owned site, (c) any claim
against any Borrower or any Environmental Affiliate that they have failed to
comply with all Environmental Requirements, and (d) the breach by any Borrower
of any representation or covenant in this ARTICLE 13.

          13.6 TESTING. After the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default
and during the continuance thereof, Agent shall have the right from time to time
to designate such persons ("ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS") as Agent may select to
visit, inspect, examine and test all properties owned or operated by and all
products and wastes generated, treated, stored, transported, handled or disposed
of by or on behalf of any Environmental Affiliate, for the purpose of
investigating compliance with Environmental Requirements, any actual or
potential claims related thereto, and any condition which could result in
potential liability, cost or expenses to any Lender if Lender has a reasonable
basis to suspect such non-compliance, actual or potential claim, and/or such
condition. Subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this
paragraph, each Borrower will permit, and will cause all Environmental
Affiliates to permit, such Environmental Consultants to have access to all of
such properties, products and wastes and all books, records and reports related
to compliance by the Environmental Affiliates with all Environmental
Requirements. Subject to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this
paragraph, each Borrower will supply, and will cause all Environmental
Affiliates to supply, Agent or the Environmental Consultants with all

<PAGE>

correspondence, audits, reviews and materials related to compliance by the
Environmental Affiliates with all Environmental Requirements and will make
available to Lender or the Environmental Consultants appropriate personnel
employed by or consultants retained by the Environmental Affiliates having
knowledge of such matters.

     The cost of such visits, inspections, examination and tests shall be borne
by Borrowers. In the event Agent or any Lender pays such costs, such sums shall
be at once repayable by Borrowers and all sums so advanced or paid by Agent or
any Lender, shall become part of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to perform any tests,
examinations or inspections or to monitor the Environmental Affiliates'
compliance with all Environmental Requirements. Upon request from Borrowers,
Agent shall, after receipt by Agent, deliver complete copies of all findings,
tests/sampling results and reports, regarding the activities undertaken by or on
behalf of or at the request of Agent at the properties. Agent agrees to cause
any Environmental Consultant prior to accessing any of Borrowers' properties to

injury, death or property damage resulting from activities described in this
ARTICLE 13 in form, content and amount acceptable to Agent in its reasonable
discretion and consistent with industry standards for such parties.

obligation of Borrowers, shall survive the occurrence of any event whatsoever,
including the payment of the Lender Indebtedness or any investigation by or

Borrower to the seller as partial payment of the purchase price payable under
such Permitted Acquisition); provided that, an amount not to exceed 50% of any

          17.2 REMEDIES. After the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, Agent may (and if directed by the Required Lenders shall), at
its election, without notice of its election and without demand, do any one or
more of the following, all of which are authorized by Borrowers:

               (a) Declare the entire unpaid principal of the Loans, all other
Obligations (including without limitations all contingent reimbursement
obligations under any Letters of Credit), or any part thereof, all interest
accrued thereon, all fees due hereunder and all other obligations of Borrowers
to Lenders hereunder or under any other Loan Document otherwise arising
immediately due and payable;

               (b) Cease advancing money, issuing Letters of Credit or otherwise
extending credit to or for the benefit of Borrowers under this Agreement, under
any of the Loan Documents, or under any other agreement between Borrowers and
the Lender Group;

               (c) Convert any Loans earning interest at LIBOR Rate plus
Applicable Margin to Loans earning interest at the Prime Rate plus Applicable
Margin and require Borrowers to indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or
expense which such Lender has sustained or incurred as a consequence of such
conversion in accordance with SECTION 5.8;

               (d) Charge interest at the Default Rate;

               (e) Terminate this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents
as to any future liability or obligation of Agent or Lenders, but without
affecting the Obligations;

               (f) Hold, as cash collateral, any and all balances and deposits
of Borrowers held by the Lender Group, and any amounts received in the Operating
Account, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;
and/or

               (g) Exercise each and every right and remedy granted to it under
the Loan Documents and under any other applicable law or at equity.

     If an Event of Default occurs under SECTIONS 17.1(F) OR (G), all of the
Obligations shall become immediately due and payable.

          17.3 SET-OFF. Without limiting the rights of each member of the Lender
Group under applicable law, each Borrower grants to each member of the Lender
Group and agrees that each member of the Lender Group may without notice to any
Borrower (such notice being expressly waived), and without constituting a
retention of any collateral in satisfaction of any Obligations (within the
meaning of Section 9-620 of the Uniform Commercial Code), at any time and from
time to time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, exercise a right of set-off, a lien against and a security interest in
all property of Borrowers now or at any time in such member of the Lender
Group's possession in any capacity whatsoever, including but not limited to any
balance of any deposit, trust or agency account, or


                                       54

<PAGE>

any other account with any member of the Lender Group, including Deposit
Accounts, as security for the Obligations. At any time and from time to time
following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any
member of the Lender Group may without notice or demand, set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such member of the
Lender Group to or for the credit of any Borrower against any or all of the
Obligations.

          17.4 TURNOVER OF PROPERTY HELD BY LENDER. Each Borrower irrevocably
authorizes any Affiliate of any member of Lender Group, following the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at the request of any member
of the Lender Group and without further notice, to turn over to Agent any
property of any Borrower held by such Affiliate, including without limitation,
funds and securities for any Borrower's account and to debit, for the benefit of
the Lender Group, any Deposit Account maintained by any Borrower with such
Affiliate (even if such Deposit Account is not then due or there results a loss
or reduction of interest or the imposition of a penalty in accordance with law
applicable to the early withdrawal of time deposits), in the amount requested by
Agent up to the amount of the Obligations, and to pay or transfer such amount or
property to Agent (for the pro-rata benefit of the Lender Group) for application
to the Obligations.

          17.5 DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. Neither the failure nor any delay
on the part of Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, power or
privilege under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
or otherwise shall operate as a waiver thereof or impair any such right, remedy,
power or privilege. No waiver of any Event of Default shall affect any later
Event of Default or shall impair any rights of Agent or any Lender. No single,
partial or full exercise of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges by Agent
or any Lender shall preclude further or other exercise thereof. No course of
dealing between Agent or any Lender and any Borrower shall operate as or be
deemed to constitute a waiver of Agent's or any Lender's rights under the Loan
Documents or affect the duties or obligations of Borrowers.

          17.6 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to all other rights, remedies, powers and privileges in
Agent's or any Lender's favor at law or in equity.

          17.7 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND DISCRETION. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, whenever Agent's or any Lender's consent or approval is
required or permitted or any documents are required to be acceptable to Agent or
any Lender, such consent, approval or acceptability shall be at the sole and
absolute discretion of Agent or such Lender. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, whenever any determination or act is at Agent's or any Lender's
discretion, such determination or act shall be at Agent's or such Lender's sole
and absolute discretion.

          17.8 CERTAIN FEES, COSTS, EXPENSE EXPENDITURES. Each Borrower agrees
to pay on demand the following cost and expenses of the Lender Group (the
"LENDER GROUP EXPENSES"):

               (a) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal costs, expenses and charges) incurred
or paid by (i) Agent in connection with advising, structuring, drafting,
preparing, reviewing, negotiating the Loan Documents or any waivers, consents,
amendments, extensions, modifications or restatements related thereto; (ii) any
member of the Lender Group in connection with enforcing, protecting, preserving,
defending or terminating any of the Loan Documents or any of the Lender Group's
rights and remedies related thereto, irrespective of whether suit is brought
(including without limitation, all costs and expenses and attorneys' fees
related to any "workout," "restructuring," insolvency or similar proceeding
involving any Borrower); and (iii) any member of the Lender Group in connection
with negotiations regarding or the defense or prosecution of any legal
proceedings involving, any claim (including third-party claims) made or
threatened against any member of the Lender Group related to or involving the
Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated under the Loan Documents or any
actions taken pursuant to the Loan Documents by the Lender Group;

               (b) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred or paid

filing; recording; publication; environmental audits; and accounting or other
professional advisors;

               (c) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred or paid
by any member of the Lender Group in connection with the disbursement of funds
under the Loan Documents (by wire transfer or otherwise); the dishonoring of
checks, drafts or other items of payment; correction or cure of any Default or
Event of Default or enforcement of the Loan Documents; or exercising any rights
or remedies under the Loan Documents; and

               (d) any and all stamp and other taxes payable or determined to be
payable in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, and
all liabilities to any member of the Lender Group may become subject as the
result of delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes.

     In the event any Borrower shall fail to pay taxes, insurance, assessments,
fees, costs or expenses which it is required to pay hereunder, Agent in its sole
discretion, may make expenditures for such purposes and the amount so expended
(including attorney's fees and expenses, filing fees and other charges) shall be
payable by Borrowers on demand and shall constitute part of the Obligations.


                                       56

<PAGE>

     With respect to any amount required to be paid by Borrowers under this
Section, in the event Borrowers fail to pay such amount on demand, at Agent's
option, all of said amounts required to be paid by Borrowers, may be charged by
Agent as a Prime Rate Loan and Borrowers shall also pay to Agent interest
thereon at the Default Rate. Each Lender shall reimburse Agent for such Lender's
Pro-Rata Share of such Loan in accordance with the terms of SECTION 5.1. If any
Lender fails to reimburse Agent for such Lender's Pro Rata Share, such Lender
shall be deemed a Defaulting Lender or be subject to the Defaulting Lender
provisions set forth in SECTION 5.1(A)(VII)(A).

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent agrees that Borrowers will not be
obligated to pay to Agent or any Lender an amount in excess of $50,000 for
attorneys' fees incurred or paid by Agent or any member of the Lender Group in
connection with advising, structuring, drafting, preparing, reviewing and/or
negotiating the Loan Documents for any period up to and including the Closing
Date.

     18. REGARDING AGENT.

          18.1 APPOINTMENT. Each Lender hereby designates Citizens to act as
Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to
exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to or required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof
and such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto and Agent shall hold
all collateral, payments of principal and interest, fees, charges and
collections received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of
Lenders. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agent
or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement,
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding; provided however, that Agent
shall not be required to take any action which exposes Agent to liability or
which is contrary to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or applicable
law unless Agent is furnished with an indemnification reasonably satisfactory to
Agent with respect thereto.

          18.2 NATURE OF DUTIES. Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be
(i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in
connection herewith, unless caused by their gross negligence (but not mere
negligence) or willful misconduct or (ii) responsible in any manner for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Borrower or any
officer thereof contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Documents or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other


                                       57

<PAGE>

Loan Documents or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower.
The duties of Agent as respects the Loans to Borrowers shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature and shall be performed by Agent with the same care and
skill as it would exercise in its capacity as agent when dealing with loans of
similar size and complexity for other lenders; Agent shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as
to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as
expressly set forth herein.

          18.3 LACK OF RELIANCE ON AGENT AND RESIGNATION.

               (a) Independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Borrower in
connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and the
taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of Borrowers. Agent shall have no duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter
except as shall be provided by Borrowers pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent
shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document,
certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution,
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or of the
financial condition of any Borrower, or be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions
or conditions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
financial condition of any Borrower, or the existence of any Event of Default or
any Default.

               (b) Agent may resign upon written notice to each of Lenders and
Borrowing Agent. The Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Agent
which in the absence of an Event of Default shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Borrowers. Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective
upon its appointment. Effective upon its resignation the former Agent's rights,
powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as
Agent, the provisions of this SECTION 18.3 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.

          18.4 CERTAIN RIGHTS OF AGENT. If Agent shall request instructions from
Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent shall be
entitled to refrain from such act or


                                       58

<PAGE>

taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from
the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by
reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have
any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of its acting or
refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the
Required Lenders.

          18.5 RELIANCE. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement,
certificate, telex, teletype or facsimile message, cablegram, order or other
document or telephone message believed in good faith by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity,
and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected
by it. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for
the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by
Agent with reasonable care.

          18.6 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Except as specifically set forth in this
SECTION 18.6, Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, unless Agent has received written notice from a Lender or from a
Borrower or Borrowing Agent referring to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, describing such Default or Event of Default. In the event that Agent
receives such a notice, or to the extent that Agent shall otherwise have actual
knowledge that an Event of Default has occurred, Agent shall give notice thereof
to Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided
that, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in
the best interests of Lenders. Agent shall, upon the taking of any such
action(s), provide Lenders with notice (which may be by telephone) of the same.

          18.7 INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and
indemnified by the Borrowers, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent
according to its Commitment Percentage from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross negligence (but
not mere negligence) or willful misconduct.

          18.8 AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. With respect to the obligation
of Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Loans made by it shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing
the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term
shall, unless the context clearly otherwise


                                       59

<PAGE>

indicates, include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may
engage in business with any Borrower ("OTHER TRANSACTIONS") as if it were not
performing the duties specified herein and may accept fees and other
consideration from any Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement
or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders.

          18.9 BORROWERS' UNDERTAKING TO AGENT. Without prejudice to its
obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each
Borrower hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on
demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of
Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not
already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto
satisfy Borrowers' obligations to make payments for the account of the Lender
Group or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement.

     19. INDEMNIFICATION AND OTHER PROVISIONS.

          19.1 INDEMNIFICATION. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, the Lender Group, their Affiliates and their officers, directors,
shareholders, employees and agents (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"),
from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses (whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party to any litigation),
including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, settlement
costs and costs of investigation, document production, attendance at depositions
or other discovery, incurred by any Indemnified Party with respect to, arising
out of or as a consequence of (a) this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, including without limitation, any failure of Borrowers to pay when
due (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, fee or
any other amount due under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any
other Event of Default; (b) the use by Borrowers of any proceeds advanced
hereunder; (c) the transactions contemplated hereunder; or (d) any claim,
demand, action or cause of action being asserted against (i) any Borrower or any
of its Affiliates by any other Person, or (ii) any Indemnified Party by any
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary, no Borrower shall
be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Party from any
liability, loss or damage resulting from the willful misconduct, gross
negligence or unlawful actions of such Indemnified Party. Any amount payable to
the Lender Group under this Section will bear interest at the Default Rate from
the due date until paid.

          Borrowers' obligations under this Section shall survive termination of
this Agreement and repayment of the Obligations.

          19.2 TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence in Borrowers'
performance of their obligations under the Loan Documents.

     20. COMMUNICATIONS AND NOTICES. All notices, requests and other
communications made or given in connection with the Loan Documents shall be in
writing and, unless receipt is stated herein to be required, shall be deemed to

<PAGE>

          21.1 WAIVERS. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY ACTION BY ANY MEMBER OF THE LENDER
GROUP IN REPLEVIN, FORECLOSURE OR OTHER COURT PROCESS OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
OTHER ACTION RELATED TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREUNDER, EACH BORROWER WAIVES:

               (a) ALL ERRORS, DEFECTS AND IMPERFECTIONS IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS;

               (b) ALL BENEFITS UNDER ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE LAWS EXEMPTING ANY
PROPERTY, REAL OR PERSONAL, OR ANY PART OF ANY PROCEEDS THEREOF FROM ATTACHMENT,
LEVY OR SALE UNDER EXECUTION, OR PROVIDING FOR ANY STAY OF EXECUTION TO BE
ISSUED ON ANY JUDGMENT RECOVERED UNDER ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR IN ANY
REPLEVIN OR FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING, OR OTHERWISE PROVIDING FOR ANY VALUATION,
APPRAISAL OR EXEMPTION;

               (c) ALL RIGHTS TO INQUISITION ON ANY REAL ESTATE, WHICH REAL
ESTATE MAY BE LEVIED UPON PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OBTAINED UNDER ANY OF THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS AND SOLD UPON ANY WRIT OF EXECUTION ISSUED THEREON IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, IN ANY ORDER DESIRED BY AGENT;

               (d) PRESENTMENT FOR PAYMENT, DEMAND, NOTICE OF DEMAND, NOTICE OF
NONPAYMENT, PROTEST AND NOTICE OF PROTEST OF ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS,
INCLUDING THE NOTES; AND

               (e) ANY REQUIREMENT FOR BONDS, SECURITY OR SURETIES REQUIRED BY
STATUTE, COURT RULE OR OTHERWISE.

     22. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each Borrower hereby consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and irrevocably agrees that, subject to Agent's
election, all actions or proceedings relating to the Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be litigated in such courts, and each
Borrower waives any objection which it may have based on lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens to the conduct of any
proceeding in any such court and waives personal service of any and all process
upon it and consents that all such service of process be made by mail or
messenger directed to it at the address set forth in SECTION 20. Nothing
contained in this Section shall affect the right of Agent or any Lender to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of Agent
or any Lender to bring any action or proceeding against any Borrower or its
property in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

     23. SALE AND ASSIGNMENT.

          23.1 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS; NEW LENDERS.


                                       62

<PAGE>

               (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of Borrowers, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Notes and their
respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Agent and each Lender.

               (b) Each Borrower acknowledges that in the regular course of
commercial banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to
time sell participating interests in the Loans to other financial institutions
(each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "TRANSFEREE").
Each Lender shall provide written notice to Agent and Borrowing Agent of any
sales of participating interests made by each Lender. In the event of any such
sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Transferee, such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any Note for all
purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Transferee may exercise all
rights of payment (including without limitation rights of set-off) with respect
to the portion of such Loans held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder
as fully as if such Transferee were the direct holder thereof provided that no
Borrower shall be required to perform any of its obligations under any Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, any payment obligations) to, or take
any direction from, any Transferee and in no event shall any Borrower be
required to pay to Agent, any Lender or any other Person for the benefit of any
Transferee more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to
Lender which granted an interest in its Loans or other Obligations payable
hereunder to such Transferee had such Lender retained such interest in the Loans
hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event shall any
Borrower be required to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances
and with respect to the same Loans or other Obligations payable hereunder to
both such Lender and such Transferee. Each Borrower hereby grants to any
Transferee a continuing security interest in any deposits, moneys or other
property actually or constructively held by such Transferee as security for the
Transferee's interest in the Loans. No such participation shall create a direct
contractual relationship between any Borrower and any such Transferee, and no
Transferee shall be given (i) the right to instruct the Lender to take or to
refrain from taking any action hereunder, or (ii) any voting rights hereunder
(other than for reductions or postponements of any amounts constituting
principal or interest on any Loans payable hereunder).

               (c) Any Lender may sell, assign or transfer its rights under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to one or more additional banks or
financial institutions reasonably acceptable to Agent and Borrowers, and one or
more additional banks or financial institutions may commit to make Loans
hereunder (each a "PURCHASING LENDER"); provided however that Borrowers shall
have no right to approve a Purchasing Lender following the occurrence and during
the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, pursuant to a Commitment
Transfer Supplement in form substantially similar to that set forth on EXHIBIT B
hereto (each, a "COMMITMENT TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT"), executed by a Purchasing
Lender, the


                                       63

<PAGE>

transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for recording, provided
however that any transfer of less than all of any Lender's rights hereunder or
any transfer to a Person who is not a Lender hereunder shall be in minimum
amounts of not less than $10,000,000. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance
and recording, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to
such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment
Percentage as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be
released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer
Supplement creating a novation for that purpose (it being understood that all
outstanding obligations of the transferor Lender shall either be satisfied by
such transferor Lender or assumed by the Purchasing Lender). Such Commitment
Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender
and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the
purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and
obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Borrowers hereby consent to the addition of such Purchasing Lender
and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the
purchase by such Purchasing Lender in accordance with the terms of this SECTION
23.1(C) of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor
Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Borrowers shall, to
the extent reasonable, execute and deliver such further documents and do such
further reasonable acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing.

               (d) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment
Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "REGISTER") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error,
and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for the purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any
Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of $5,000 payable by the
applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or
assignment to such Purchasing Lender.

               (e) Each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Transferee or Purchasing Lender and any prospective Transferee or Purchasing
Lender any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning
Borrowers which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of Borrowers
pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation
of such Borrowers.

               (f) Each Borrower agrees to take all actions that Agent may
reasonably request in attempting to sell, transfer or assign any of its rights
or interest under this Agreement. Such actions include, but are not limited to,
(a) Borrowers causing senior management and representatives of Borrowers to be
available to participate in information


                                       64

<PAGE>

meetings with prospective Purchasing Lenders at such times and places as Agent
may reasonably request, and (b) Borrowers providing Agent with all information
reasonably requested by Agent in order to accomplish such sale, transfer or
assignment.

               (g) In addition to the foregoing provisions, any Lender may at
any time pledge or assign all or any portion of its rights under the Loan
Documents (including any portion of any Note) to any of the twelve (12) Federal
Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12, U.S.C.
Section 341. No such pledge or assignment or enforcement thereof shall release
any Lender from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents or substituting
any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

     24. BORROWING AGENCY.

          24.1 BORROWING AGENCY PROVISIONS.

               (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates Borrowing Agent
to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse
notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further
assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower or
Borrowers, and hereby authorizes Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds
hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Agent.

               (b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing
facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is
solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at their request. Neither Agent nor
any Lender shall incur liability to Borrowers as a result thereof. To induce
Agent and Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby
indemnifies Agent and each Lender and holds Agent and each Lender harmless from
and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of
damage or injury asserted against Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from
or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Borrowers
as provided herein, reliance by Agent or any Lender on any request or
instruction from Borrowing Agent or any other action taken by Agent or any
Lender with respect to this SECTION 24.1 except due to willful misconduct or
gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party.

               (c) All Obligations shall be joint and several, and each Borrower
shall make payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or
otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Borrower shall
in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted by
Agent or any Lender to any Borrower, failure of Agent or any Lender to give any
Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure of Agent or any
Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Borrower, and such agreement
by each Borrower to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional
and unaffected by prior recourse by Agent or any Lender to the other Borrowers
or the lack thereof.

          24.2 SUBROGATION. Each Borrower expressly waives any and all rights of
subrogation, reimbursement , indemnity, exoneration, contribution of any other
claim which such


                                       65

<PAGE>

Borrower may now or hereafter have against the other Borrowers or other Person
directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or
with respect to the other Borrowers' property, arising from the existence or
performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment
in full of the Obligations.

     25. MISCELLANEOUS.

          25.1 MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT.

               (a) The Required Lenders and Borrowers may, subject to the
provisions of this SECTION 25.1, from time to time enter into written
supplemental agreements to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents executed
by Borrowers, for the purpose of adding or deleting any provisions or otherwise
changing, varying or waiving in any manner the rights of Lenders, Agent or
Borrowers thereunder or the conditions, provisions or terms thereof or waiving
any Default or Event of Default thereunder, but only to the extent specified in
such written agreements; provided however, that no such supplemental agreement
shall without the consent of Agent and the Lender Group (i) increase the
Commitment Percentage of any Lender, (ii) extend the final maturity of any Note
or any scheduled due date under SECTION 2.1 hereof, or decrease the rate of
interest or reduce any fee payable by any Borrower to any such Lender pursuant
to this Agreement, (iii) alter the definition of the term Required Lenders or
alter, amend or modify this SECTION 25.1, (iv) change the rights and duties of
Agent, (v) increase the Loans; or (vi) release any Borrower from any of its
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.

               (b) Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each
Lender and shall be binding upon Borrower, Lenders and Agent and all future
holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, Borrowers, Agent and
Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of
Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of
a specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default
(whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of
Default which was waived), or impair any right resulting from such subsequent
Event of Default.

          25.2 BROKERS. The transaction contemplated hereunder was brought about
and entered into by the Lender Group and Borrowers acting as principals and
without any brokers, agents or finders being the effective procuring cause
hereof. Each Borrower represents to the Lender Group that no Borrower has
committed the Lender Group to the payment of any brokerage fee or commission in
connection with this transaction. If any such claim is made against the Lender
Group by any broker, finder or agent or any other Person, each Borrower agrees
to indemnify, defend and hold the Lender Group harmless against any such claim,
at Borrowers' own cost and expense, including the Lender Group's attorneys'
fees. Each Borrower further agrees that until any such claim or demand is
adjudicated in the Lender Group's favor, the amount claimed and/or demanded
shall be deemed part of the Obligations.


                                       66

<PAGE>

          25.3 USE OF AGENT'S OR LENDER'S NAME. No Borrower shall use the name
of any member of the Lender Group or the name of any Affiliate of any member of
the Lender Group in connection with any of their business or activities except
as may otherwise be required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any like regulatory body and except as may be required in
their dealings with any governmental agency.

          25.4 NO JOINT VENTURE. Nothing contained herein is intended to permit
or authorize any Borrower to make any contract on behalf of the Lender Group,
nor shall this Agreement be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture
or making the Lender Group an investor in any Borrower.

          25.5 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by any Borrower in the Loan Documents or made by or on their
behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated herein shall be true at
all times this Agreement is in effect and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents, any investigation at any time made by the Lender
Group or on their behalf and the making by the Lender Group of the loans or
advances to Borrowers. All statements contained in any certificate, statement or
other document delivered by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant hereto or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed
representations and warranties by Borrowers.

          25.6 NO ASSIGNMENT. No Borrower may assign any of its rights hereunder
without the prior written consent of Agent.

          25.7 PUBLICITY. Agent may use its discretion in disclosing the fact,
but not the terms and conditions, of the financing under this Agreement to any
public forum including, without limitations, "tombstone" announcements in the
print media whether individually or part of a general advertisement.

          25.8 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and all rights and powers granted
hereby will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

          25.9 SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement and all other Loan
Documents are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall
continue in full force and effect.

          25.10 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The rights and benefits of this
Agreement and the Loan Documents shall not inure to the benefit of any third
party.

          25.11 HOLIDAYS. If the day provided herein for the payment of any
amount or the taking of any action falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday
at the place for payment or action, then the due date for such payment or action
will be the next succeeding Business Day.

          25.12 LAW GOVERNING. This Agreement has been made, executed and
delivered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and will be construed in

any rules or principles regarding conflicts of law or any rule or canon of
construction which interprets agreements against the draftsman.

          25.13 INTEGRATION. The Loan Documents shall be construed as integrated

Lender Group's rights, powers and remedies. The Loan Documents contain the
entire understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the matters

under the Loan Documents may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall constitute an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Delivery of a photocopy or telecopy of an executed

delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Loan Document.

          25.17 JOINT AND SEVERAL. The obligations of Borrowers under this
Agreement shall be joint and several obligations.

          25.18 LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. Each Borrower and the Lender Group agree
that, in any action, suit or proceeding, in respect of or arising out of this
Agreement, the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereunder, each
mutually waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim for
consequential, punitive or special damages.

          25.19 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH BORROWER AND THE LENDER
GROUP WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF
