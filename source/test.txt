                                     PART I

                                ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

         Abrams  Industries,  Inc.  engages  in (i)  construction  of retail and
commercial  projects;  (ii)  manufacturing  store  fixtures,  bank  fixtures and
display units for retail outlets;  and (iii) asset  management,  development and
re-development   of   income-producing   properties,    including   acquisition,
investment, management and sale.

         The Company was organized  under Delaware law in 1960 to succeed to the
business of A. R. Abrams, Inc., which was founded in 1925 by Alfred R. Abrams as
a sole  proprietorship.  In 1984, the Company changed its state of incorporation
from Delaware to Georgia.  As used herein,  the term "Company"  refers to Abrams
Industries,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries  and  predecessors,  unless the context
indicates otherwise.

         Financial  information by operating  segment is set forth in Note 13 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

                              CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT

         The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary,  Abrams Construction,
Inc., has engaged in the construction  business since 1925. Although the Company
does work throughout much of the United States,  it concentrates  its activities
principally  in the South.  Construction  activities  consist  primarily  of new
construction,  expansion,  and remodeling of retail store buildings,  banks, and
shopping centers.

         Construction   contracts  are  obtained  by  competitive   bid  and  by
negotiation.  Generally,  purchasing of materials and services for the Company's
construction operations is done on a project-by-project basis.

                              MANUFACTURING SEGMENT

         The  Company,  through  its wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Abrams  Fixture
Corporation, has engaged in manufacturing and selling store fixtures since 1946,
and has been designing and producing  point-of-purchase and other displays since
1975.  The  Company  engineers  and  fabricates  displays,  check-out  counters,
cabinets,  tables and other store fixtures of wood,  metal and plastic  laminate
for sale  primarily  to several  of the larger  national  retail  store  chains.
Substantially  all of the store  fixtures are  fabricated to meet the customer's
requirements for type, size, shape and color and are generally  produced against
specific  orders.  The Company also produces  custom-designed  point-of-purchase
display units which are sold to floorcovering  and  wallcovering  manufacturers,
distributors, and retailers.

         In 1997, the Company began manufacturing and installing custom designed
bank fixtures,  including  structural  wall and ceiling  components,  for branch
banks in supermarkets throughout the United States.

         During the summer of 1998, the Company moved into its new manufacturing
facility.  This  facility is owned by the Real Estate  Segment and leased to the
Manufacturing Segment. See "ITEM 2. PROPERTIES".

         The Company maintains raw material inventories of items such as lumber,
plywood,  metals,  particle board,  laminates,  and hardware.  In the opinion of
management,  the raw  materials  and  supplies  utilized by this  Segment of the
Company are available from numerous sources.

                               REAL ESTATE SEGMENT

         The Company,  through its wholly owned subsidiary,  Abrams  Properties,
Inc., has engaged in real estate development, redevelopment and asset management
activities since 1960. These activities have involved  primarily the development
and  management of shopping  centers in the Southeast and Midwest.  Selection of
target markets;  evaluation and  acquisition of sites;  marketing to prospective
tenants;  negotiation  of tenant  leases;  securing  construction  and permanent
financing; contracting for design and construction;  management of construction;
expansion,  renovation and re-tenanting of properties;  maintenance of buildings
and grounds of owned and leased properties; and marketing and sale of properties
to investors  are all part of the Company's  asset  management  and  development
activities.  In 1998, the Company began  investing in existing  income-producing
properties,  including office and retail originally developed by others. Also in
1998, the Company developed an industrial facility for the Manufacturing Segment
and in order to diversify the Company's real estate portfolio.

         Excluding  the  Newnan,   Georgia  shopping  center,   which  was  sold
subsequent  to April 30,  1999,  the  Company  currently  owns and  manages  six
shopping centers,  all of which are held as long-term  investments.  Five of the
centers  were  developed  by the Company,  and one was  purchased.  See "ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES - Owned Shopping Centers".  The Company is also lessee and manager of
nine Company-  developed shopping centers which were sold and leased back by the
Company.   See  "ITEM  2.  PROPERTIES  -  Leaseback  Shopping  Centers".   Kmart
Corporation is an anchor tenant in most of the Company's  shopping centers.  The
Company  also  owns two  office  properties.  See "ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES  - Office
Buildings".

                        EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

         At April 30, 1999, the Company employed 171 salaried  employees and 163
hourly  employees.  The hourly  employees  at Abrams  Fixture  Corporation  were
formerly  represented by one union pursuant to a contract which expired in April
1999. The Company has no other union agreements.  On its construction  jobs, the
Company  utilizes local labor whenever  practicable,  paying the prevailing wage
scale. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.





<PAGE>
                           SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS

         The Company's  business has historically been slightly  seasonal,  with
the  Construction  Segment  being  affected by weather  conditions.  The Company
limits this  exposure  by  operating  in several  regions of the  country,  with
operations  primarily in the southern  United  States  where  favorable  weather
conditions prevail for most of the year. The business of the Real Estate Segment
and Manufacturing Segment is generally less seasonal.

                                   COMPETITION

         The  businesses  of  the  Company  are  highly   competitive.   In  its
Construction  and  Manufacturing  Segments,  the Company  competes  with a large
number of national and local  construction  companies and fixture  manufacturers
and suppliers,  many of which have greater financial resources than the Company.
The Company also competes with smaller  specialized  companies.  The Real Estate
Segment also  operates in an extremely  competitive  environment,  with numerous
companies competing for available financing, properties, tenants and investors.

                               PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS

         During   fiscal   1999,   the   Company   derived   approximately   53%
($100,585,000)  of its consolidated  revenues from direct  transactions with The
Home  Depot,  Inc.  These  revenues   resulted   principally  from  construction
activities  and  sales  of  manufactured  store  fixtures.  See  Note  13 to the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of the Company.  No other  single  customer
accounted  for 10% or more of the  Company's  consolidated  revenues  during the
year.

         The  following  table  indicates  the  backlog  of  contracts,  orders,

      =========================================================================
</TABLE>

         The Company  estimates that most of the backlog at April 30, 1999, will
be  completed  prior to April 30, 2000.  No assurance  can be given as to future
backlog  levels or whether the Company will realize  earnings  from the revenues
resulting from the backlog at April 30, 1999.

                                   REGULATION

         The  Company  is subject to the  authority  of various  state and local
regulatory  agencies  concerned  with the licensing of  contractors,  but it has
experienced  no material  difficulty in complying  with such  requirements.  The
Company is also  subject  to local  zoning  regulations  and  building  codes in
performing its construction and real estate activities. Management believes that
it  is  in  substantial  compliance  with  all  such  governmental  regulations.
Management  believes that  compliance with federal,  state and local  provisions
which have been  enacted or adopted for  regulating  the  discharge of materials
into  the  environment  does  not  have  a  material  effect  upon  the  capital
expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.

         During the summer of 1998, the Manufacturing Segment relocated its wood
manufacturing,  warehousing and metal fabrication facilities to a 250,000 square
foot facility,  owned by the Real Estate Segment and located in Lithia  Springs,
Georgia,  a suburb of Atlanta.  The former wood  manufacturing  facility,  which
contains  approximately  255,000 square feet of light industrial,  warehouse and
office space,  has been marketed for sale.  In June 1999,  the Company  received
notice  from the  Georgia  State  Properties  Commission  that the  former  wood
manufacturing  facility is needed for public use.  The  Georgia  World  Congress
Center Authority  (GWCCA) has made the determination to acquire the property and
has offered to acquire the property for  $3,500,000.  The Company has  responded
with what it believes to be a  reasonable  counterproposal.  GWCCA,  in its sole
discretion,  may choose to accept the  counterproposal,  negotiate  further,  or
proceed with eminent domain.

         In May 1999,  the Company sold its shopping  center  located in Newnan,
Georgia. The sale was structured as a tax-deferred,  like-kind exchange pursuant
to Internal  Revenue Code Section 1031,  which allows a deferral of the tax gain
if the Company  utilizes the proceeds of the sale to purchase  other real estate
within 180 days of the sale.  The Company  recognized a gain on the sale of this
property for  financial  statement  purposes in the first quarter of fiscal year
ending  2000.  See "ITEM 7.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES"  for  discussion
regarding  the  purchase  in  July  1999,  of  other  real  estate   located  in
Jacksonville, Florida.

         In addition,  the Company  owns,  or has an interest in, the  following
properties:

         With the exception of the Kmart lease in Columbus,  Georgia, all of the
anchor tenant and most of the small shop leases provide for  contingent  rentals
if sales  exceed  specified  amounts.  Most major  tenants have rights to offset
those contingent rentals against certain annual operating expenses paid by them.
In 1999, the Company  received  $85,152 in contingent  rentals,  net of offsets,
which amounts are included in the aggregate rentals set forth above.

         Typically,  tenants  are  responsible  for their  pro rata  share of ad
valorem taxes,  insurance and common area  maintenance  (subject to the right of
offset discussed above). Kmart has complete  maintenance  responsibility for the
Morton, Illinois and Columbus, Georgia centers.

                           LEASEBACK SHOPPING CENTERS

         The  Company,  through  its Real  Estate  Segment,  is  lessee  of nine
shopping centers which it developed, sold, and leased back under leases expiring
from years 2001 to 2014.  The nine centers are subleased by the Company to Kmart
Corporation  for  periods  corresponding  to the  Company's  leases.  The  Kmart
subleases provide for contingent rentals if sales exceed specified amounts,  and
contain ten five-year renewal options,  except Jacksonville,  Florida, which has
eight  five-year  renewal  options.  The  Company's  leases  with the fee owners
contain  renewal options  coextensive  with Kmart's  renewal  options.  Kmart is
responsible  for  insurance  and ad valorem  taxes,  but has the right to offset
against  contingent  rentals any such taxes paid in excess of specified amounts.
In 1999, the Company  received  $86,121 in contingent  rentals,  net of offsets,
which amounts are included in the aggregate  annual rentals set forth below. The
Company has responsibility for structural and roof maintenance of the buildings.
The Company  also has  responsibility  for parking  lots and  driveways,  except
routine upkeep, which is the responsibility of the tenant,  Kmart. The Company's
leases contain exculpatory provisions which limit the Company's liability to its
interest in the respective subleases.

NOTES:

<F1>  The  increases  in  1999  from  those  in  1998  and  1997  primarily  are
      attributable  to the  addition  of new  customers.  The  amounts  reported
      exclude  $1,114,823 in 1999 and $5,026,181 in 1998 related to construction
      of a new  facility  for the  Manufacturing  Segment,  and $345,000 in 1997
      related to construction work at two shopping centers developed by the Real
      Estate Segment.

<F2> The increase in 1999 from that  in 1998 primarily  is  attributable  to an
     increase  in  business  from an existing  customer.  The  amounts  reported
     exclude $501,220 in 1999 and $181,003 in 1998 related to manufactured items
     supplied to one of the Construction Segment's customers.

<F3>Rental revenues for 1999 were  $12,449,850,  compared to $11,334,279 in 1998
    and  $11,770,889 in 1997.  Rental  revenues  exclude  $1,485,038 in 1999 and
    $200,615 in 1998 received from affiliated companies.  Revenues from sales of
    real estate were  $10,024,650 in 1998 and $9,214,758 in 1997.  There were no
    sales of real estate in 1999. The 1998 real estate revenues include sales of
    a  shopping  center in  Oakwood,  Georgia,  freestanding  Kmarts in  Tifton,
    Georgia,  and Newark,  Ohio, and an outparcel in North Fort Myers,  Florida.
    The 1997 real estate sales include  outparcel  sales in Englewood,  Florida,
    and Oakwood,  Georgia, and freestanding Kmarts in Niles, Michigan,  Shawnee,
    Oklahoma, and Warner Robins, Georgia.

<FN>
NOTES:
<F1>  The increases in costs and  percentages in 1999 as  compared to 1998  and
      1997 are a result of a loss in production efficiencies and increased labor
      costs  incurred  during  and  after  the  move  to the  new  manufacturing
      facility.  As of May 31, 1999,  the Company had reduced its  Manufacturing
      labor force by 27% since it reached its peak in December, 1998. Management
      is   continuing   its  review  of   operations  to  identify  cost  saving
      opportunities which would generate increased gross margins.

<F2>  The decrease in the dollar amount in 1999 is  attributable  to the absence
      of real  estate  sales  during the year,  as compared  to  $5,157,462  and
      $4,085,881  in costs  attributable  to real estate sales in 1998 and 1997,
      respectively.  The decrease in the dollar amount and percentage in 1999 as
      compared to 1997 is also  attributable  to a 1997 provision for impairment
      loss of  $2,750,000  to reduce  the net  carrying  value of the North Fort
      Myers,  Florida  shopping  center to  estimated  fair value.  There was no
      impairment loss provision in 1999 or 1998. See Note 6 to the  Consolidated
      Financial Statements for further discussion.

             SELLING, SHIPPING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

         For the years  1999,  1998 and 1997,  Selling,  shipping,  general  and
administrative  expenses  (See  Chart  C)  were  $13,558,676,   $13,571,655  and

expenses were 7% for 1999, 8% for 1998,  and 9% for 1997. In reviewing  Chart C,
the reader should  recognize  that the volume of revenues  generally will affect
these amounts and percentages.  The percentages in Chart C are based on expenses
as they relate to segment  revenues in Chart A, with the  exception  that Parent

</TABLE>

                                 INTEREST COSTS

         The majority of interest costs expensed of $5,262,399,  $4,666,290, and
$4,779,102,  in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively,  is related  to debt on real
estate and  utilization  of lines of credit.  Interest  costs  increased in 1999
primarily  due to the debt  service on the  $11,000,000  industrial  development
revenue bonds issued to finance the  Manufacturing  Segment's new facility.  See
"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" below.  Interest costs of $199,000,  $112,000,
and $25,000,  relating to properties under  development in 1999, 1998, and 1997,
respectively, were capitalized.

             FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

         Property  held for sale  increased by $3,576,714 in 1999 as a result of
the reclassification of the shopping center in Newnan,  Georgia,  which was sold
in May 1999, as discussed in "Item 2.  Properties." This property was previously
included in Income-producing  properties.  The only other property held for sale
at April 30,  1999,  was the  Company's  former wood  manufacturing  facility in
Atlanta,  Georgia. See previous discussion in "Item 2. Properties" regarding the
potential  sale or eminent  domain  proceedings  to acquire this  facility.  The
mortgage  debt  associated  with  both  properties  has  been   reclassified  as
short-term.

         Property,  plant and  equipment  increased by  $2,511,777  during 1999,
primarily as a result of the construction costs related to the completion of the
Manufacturing Segment's new facility. The facility was completed in early summer
1998 and is now  fully  operational.  For  further  information  related  to the
financing of this property, see "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES".


<PAGE>
                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Except  for  certain  real  estate  construction  loans and  occasional
short-term  operating  loans,  the Company normally has been able to finance its
working capital needs through funds generated internally.  If adequate funds are
not generated through normal operations, the Company has available bank lines of
credit.  The Company has also developed  relationships  with various banks which
management  believes  could  be  sources  for  other  short-term  and  long-term
financing,  if required.  Working capital  decreased to $9,885,902 at the end of
1999,  from  $15,283,031  and  $13,075,119,   at  the  end  of  1998  and  1997,
respectively. Operating activities used cash of $8,185,746. Investing activities
used  cash of  $3,855,868,  primarily  for  construction  of the  Company's  new
manufacturing facility. Financing activities provided cash of $6,249,694.

         In April 1992, the Company  secured a  construction  loan for the North
Fort Myers,  Florida  development  from  SunTrust  Bank,  Atlanta.  The loan was
amended in April 1994,  August 1995,  March 1996,  July 1997,  March 1998,  July
1998, and December 1998. The primary term of the construction financing was five
years,  and the loan has been extended to June 2000, in accordance with the loan
agreement.  The loan carries a floating  interest rate of prime plus .375%.  The
maximum  amount to be funded  will be  determined  by a formula  based on future
development.  As of  April  30,  1999,  the  principal  amount  outstanding  was
$13,727,933.  Although the Company has periodically  received extensions on this
loan,  there can be no assurance it will be able to continue to do so. If future
extensions  were not granted,  it would be  necessary  for the Company to either
refinance or sell the  development  and pay off this loan prior to its due date.
There can be no assurance  that  sufficient  proceeds from a refinancing or sale
will be available to pay off the loan prior to its maturity.

         In August 1997, the Company refinanced the $2,100,000 construction loan
on its Jackson,  Michigan  shopping center with a permanent loan for $3,500,000.
The  permanent  loan has a term of 22 years and bears  interest  at 8.625%.  The
provisions of the loan, as amended in August 1998, required the establishment of
a $500,000  letter of credit at closing which is to be used to pay down the loan
in August 1999,  if certain  leasing  requirements  are not met. As of April 30,
1999, these  requirements  have not been met, and there can be no assurance that
they will be met by August 1999.

         In  October  1997,  the  Company   entered  into  an  acquisition   and
construction  loan  with  SunTrust  Bank,  Atlanta,  to fund  the  purchase  and
renovations  of the corporate  headquarters  building in Atlanta,  Georgia.  The
maximum amount of the loan is $5,200,000.  The loan was amended in December 1998
to extend  the  maturity  date to May 2000.  There can be no  assurance  further
extensions will be granted. The Company has the option of paying interest at the
prime rate or based on the Eurodollar rate plus 2.0%, which may be locked in for
one, two, three, or six month periods at the Company's  discretion.  The Company
plans to  refinance  this  loan  prior to  maturity,  however,  there  can be no
assurance that a refinancing will take place prior to the loan's due date.

         In November  1997, the Company  closed on the  $11,000,000,  twenty-one
year bond financing for its new manufacturing  facility. The bonds bear interest
at prevailing  market rates,  reset weekly. In an effort to minimize exposure to
interest rate  fluctuations  in connection  with the bonds,  the Company entered
into two separate interest rate swap agreements with SunTrust Bank,  Atlanta, in
February  1998.  The first swap  agreement  terminates  in  February  2001.  The
notional  amount reduces  annually from $5,500,000 at inception to $5,300,000 at
the  expiration of the  agreement.  The agreement  calls for the Company to make
fixed rate  payments to SunTrust of 5.57% per annum of the notional  amount,  in
exchange  for  SunTrust  making  floating  rate  payments  based  on the  30-day
Non-financial  AA Commercial Paper rate. The second interest rate swap agreement
terminates  in  February  2003.  The  notional  amount  reduces   annually  from
$5,500,000 at inception to $5,057,500 at the  expiration of the  agreement.  The
remaining terms of the second  agreement are identical to the terms of the first
except the fixed rate payment is 5.67% per annum.  The  notional  amounts of the
swap agreements are set to match the outstanding  principal amount of the bonds.
The swap  floating  rates are reset  weekly,  and the Company  settles  with the
counterparty  monthly. The Company expects the counterparty to the agreements to
abide by the terms of the agreements.

         At April 30, 1999, the Company had unsecured  committed lines of credit
totaling  $13,000,000,  of which  $7,600,000 was  outstanding  and an additional
$500,000 was reserved for the letter of credit issued for the Jackson,  Michigan
loan discussed  above.  The Company also had a committed line of credit totaling
$2,500,000, secured by the Manufacturing Segment's inventory and receivables, of
which $448,222 was outstanding at year end.

         On April  30,  1999,  in order to  facilitate  the sale of the  Newnan,
Georgia shopping  center,  the Company drew $5,600,000 on the lines of credit to
have funds  available to pay the related  mortgage debt. This draw was repaid in
May 1999. In July 1999, the Company  purchased an  approximately  174,000 square
foot shopping  center located in  Jacksonville,  Florida,  for  $9,000,000.  The
purchase was financed with funds  received from the sale of the Newnan,  Georgia
shopping  center,  cash held by the Company,  and the Company's lines of credit.
Subsequently,  the Company  closed on a permanent  mortgage  loan secured by the
property  and used the proceeds to pay back the lines of credit.  The  permanent
loan,  in the  amount  of  $9,500,000,  bears  interest  at 7.375% and is fully
amortizable over twenty years.  Loan proceeds received in excess of the purchase
price  were used to pay  financing  costs and are  available  for use for tenant
improvements  and  commissions on future  leases.  The loan may be called at any
time by the lender after September 1, 2002. If the loan were called, the Company
would  have up to  thirteen  months  to  prepay  the loan  without  penalty.  In
conjunction with the loan, an Additional  Interest  Agreement was executed which
entitles the lender to be paid additional interest equal to fifty percent of the
quarterly  net cash flow and fifty percent of the  appreciation  in the property
upon sale or refinance.

             EFFECTS OF INFLATION ON REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFITS

         The  effects of  inflation  upon the  Company's  operating  results are
varied. Inflation in the current year has been modest and has had minimal effect
on the Company.  The Construction Segment subcontracts most of its work at fixed
prices,  which  normally  will help  that  segment  protect  its  profit  margin
percentage.

         In the Manufacturing Segment, the raw material prices were stable.

         In the Real Estate  Segment,  many of the leases are long-term (over 20
years) with fixed  rents  except for  contingent  rent  provisions  by which the
Company may earn  additional rent as a result of increases in tenants' sales. In
most cases,  however, the contingent rent provisions permit the tenant to offset
against  contingent  rents any  increases  in ad valorem  taxes over a specified
amount.  If inflation  were to rise,  ad valorem taxes would  probably  increase
which, in turn, would cause a decrease in the contingent rents. Furthermore, the
Company has certain repair  obligations,  and the costs of repairs increase with
inflation.

         Inflation causes a rise in interest rates,  which has a positive effect
on investment income, but has a negative effect on profit margins because of the
increased costs of contracts,  production,  and operations.  Overall,  inflation
will tend to limit the Company's  markets and, in turn,  will reduce revenues as
well as operating profits.

                                    YEAR 2000

         The Year 2000 has  presented a problem for  companies  who use computer
systems  which were  developed  without the ability to  properly  recognize  and
process  data  relating  to the year 2000 and beyond.  Such  systems may include
hardware,  software and other  telecommunications  information  systems (IT), as
well as computer systems that do not relate to information  technology,  such as
building  and other  ancillary  systems  (non-IT).  The  Company,  its  vendors,
suppliers,  and other  significant third party service providers are all exposed
to the  potential  disruption  of operations if such systems are not replaced or
remediated.

         The Company  substantially has completed its assessment and remediation
efforts for achieving  Year 2000  compliance in its IT and non-IT  systems.  All
computer   hardware  and  software  have  been   inventoried  and  tested.   The
Construction Segment has purchased a new Year 2000 compliant accounting software
package and upgraded its computer hardware system.  The cost of the software and
hardware and the  installation  thereof is not  considered  to be material.  The
Company  installed the new hardware and software  during the second quarter 1999
and began using it in the third quarter 1999. The  Manufacturing  Segment,  at a
nominal cost, plans to upgrade its current  accounting  software to be Year 2000
compliant by August 1999, and the Real Estate Segment's  accounting  software is
Year 2000  compliant.  Other  non-compliant  hardware  and  software  review and
remediation costs are considered to be minimal.

         The  Company  has  conducted  a  written  survey  of its IT and  non-IT
significant  third party vendors and service  providers to determine  their Year
2000 compliance  status.  The responses have indicated these  businesses will be
substantially  compliant on a timely basis. The Company,  however, cannot ensure
that various third parties with which it deals will be Year 2000 compliant.  The
failure of such third parties, such as banks, significant customers, tenants and
vendors to become Year 2000  compliant  on a timely  basis could have an adverse
impact on the Company's business.

         Uncertainty  exists  concerning  the  scope and  magnitude  of the most
reasonably  likely  worst  case  scenario.  The  Company  has  not  developed  a
contingency  plan for dealing with any  catastrophic  failure of the government,
utility companies,  lending  institutions or other regulated agencies,  but will
consider the need for such if public or other information regarding the state of
readiness  of  these  entities  or other  significant  third  parties  indicates
imminent problems.

         There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and
correct  all  aspects  of the  effect  of the Year  2000  issue on the  Company.
Management,  however,  does not  believe  that the Year  2000  issue  will  pose
significant  problems in its IT or non-IT  systems,  or that  resolution  of any
potential  problems with respect to these systems will have a material effect on
the  Company's  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.  Readers  are
cautioned that  forward-looking  statements regarding Year 2000 issues should be
read in conjunction with the Company's disclosures under the heading "Cautionary
statement regarding forward-looking information."

           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

         Certain  statements  contained  or  incorporated  by  reference in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation,  statements containing
the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects," and words of similar import, are
forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of the federal  securities laws.
Such forward-looking  statements involve known and unknown risks,  uncertainties
and  other  matters  which  may  cause  the  actual   results,   performance  or
achievements of the Company to be materially  different from any future results,
performance  or  uncertainties  expressed  or  implied  by such  forward-looking
statements.  Such risks,  uncertainties  and other matters include,  but are not
limited to, Year 2000 compliance issues.


                     CONSIDERATION OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES

         The  Company  announced  on June 8, 1999,  that the Board of  Directors
decided  to  investigate  a wide  range  of  possible  strategic  and  financial
alternatives that may be available to maximize  shareholder value. In connection
with this activity,  the management of the Construction  Segment  approached the
Company  in  order to begin  discussing  the  possibility  of  purchasing  their
segment's  business.  After a period of investigation  and  deliberation,  those
discussions  were  terminated.  The Company has not formalized  any  alternative
strategy,  and  although  the  investigation  of other  possible  strategic  and
financial  alternatives  is ongoing,  there is no assurance  whatsoever that any
transaction ultimately will result.

<FN>
<F1>  In an effort  to  minimize  exposure  to  interest  rate  fluctuations  in
      connection  with  these  bonds,  the  Company  entered  into two  separate
      interest rate swap  agreements  with SunTrust Bank,  Atlanta,  in February
      1998. The first swap  agreement  terminates in February 2001. The notional
      amount reduces  annually from $5,500,000 at inception to $5,300,000 at the
      expiration of the agreement.  The agreement  calls for the Company to make
      fixed rate payments to SunTrust of 5.57% per annum of the notional amount,
      in exchange for SunTrust making floating rate payments based on the 30-day
      Non-financial  AA  Commercial  Paper rate.  The second  interest rate swap
      agreement  terminates  in  February  2003.  The  notional  amount  reduces
      annually from  $5,500,000 at inception to $5,057,500 at the  expiration of
      the agreement.  The remaining terms of the second  agreement are identical
      to the  terms of the first  except  the fixed  rate  payment  is 5.67% per
      annum.  The notional  amounts of the swap  agreements are set to match the
      outstanding  principal  amount of the bonds.  The swap floating  rates are
      reset weekly, and the Company settles with the counterparty monthly.
<F2>  $500,000 is restricted as it secures a letter of credit. See Note 9 to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Abrams Industries, Inc.:


         We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Abrams
Industries,  Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as listed in the accompanying
index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated  financial  statements,
we also  have  audited  the  financial  statement  schedules  as  listed  in the
accompanying  index.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial
statement  schedules are the  responsibility  of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Abrams
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results
of their  operations  and cash  flows  for each of the  years in the  three-year
period ended April 30, 1999, in conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  information set forth
therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         APRIL 30, 1999, 1998, AND 1997

                          (1) ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

         Abrams  Industries,  Inc. (the  "Company") was organized under Delaware
law in 1960.  In 1984,  the  Company  changed  its state of  incorporation  from
Delaware  to  Georgia.  The Company  engages in (i)  construction  of retail and
commercial  projects,  (ii) manufacturing of store fixtures,  bank  fixtures and
display units for retail outlets, and (iii) asset management,  development,  and
redevelopment of income-producing properties, including acquisition, investment,
management  and sale.  The Company's  wholly owned  subsidiaries  include Abrams
Construction,  Inc., Abrams Fixture Corporation, and Abrams Properties, Inc. and
subsidiaries.

                 (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)  PRINCIPLES OF  CONSOLIDATION  AND BASIS OF  PRESENTATION
     The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of Abrams
     Industries,  Inc., its wholly owned  subsidiaries and its 80% investment in
     Abrams-Columbus Limited Partnership.  All significant intercompany balances
     and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Company to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
     disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of the
     financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
     during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from those
     estimates.

(b)  INCOME RECOGNITION
     Construction revenues are reported on the percentage-of-completion  method,
     using costs  incurred to date in relation to  estimated  total costs of the
     contracts to measure the stage of  completion.  The  cumulative  effects of
     changes in estimated  total contract costs and revenues are recorded in the
     period in which the facts requiring the revisions become known. At the time
     it is  determined  that a  contract  will  result  in a  loss,  the  entire
     estimated loss is recorded.

     Revenues  from  the  sales of real  estate  are  recognized  at the time of
     closing.  When a  portion  or unit of a  development  property  is sold,  a
     proportionate  share of the  projected  total  cost of the  development  is
     charged to cost of sales.  Costs of sales  related to real estate are based
     on the specific property sold.

     Generally,  revenues from the sale of manufactured  goods are recognized on
     the date products are shipped to the customer. Revenues from certain sales,
     on which  delivery  is  delayed at the  customer's  explicit  request,  are
     recognized  when conditions for revenue  recognition are met;  principally,
     the completed  product is ready for delivery and transfer of both title and
     risk of ownership has passed to the buyer.

(c)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
     Cash and cash  equivalents  include money market funds and other  financial
     instruments.  The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with
     maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     In 1999, restricted cash consists of a bond sinking fund which will be used
     to pay down the principal on the industrial  development  revenue bonds. In
     1998, restricted cash included proceeds from the issuance of the industrial
     development  revenue bonds. The proceeds of these bonds were restricted for
     use in constructing and equipping the Company's new manufacturing facility.

(d)  INVENTORIES
     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
     market. To reflect the inventory at the lower of cost or market,  valuation
     reserves are established. Management periodically evaluates the adequacy of
     reserves based on aging, sales and other relevant factors.

(e)  PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE
     Property  held for  sale is  expected  to be sold in the  near  term and is
     carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation
     and   amortization   are  suspended  during  the  sale  period  except  for
     manufacturing facilities that are necessary for operation.





<PAGE>
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued)

(F)  INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
     Income-producing  properties  are stated at the lower of cost or fair value
     and  are   depreciated   for  financial   reporting   purposes   using  the
     straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives of the properties and
     related assets.

     Property,  plant,  and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated for
     financial  reporting  purposes  using  the  straight-line  method  over the
     estimated  useful lives of the assets.  Significant  additions which extend
     asset  lives are  capitalized.  Normal  maintenance  and  repair  costs are
     expensed as incurred.

     Interest and other carrying costs related to assets under  construction are
     capitalized.  Costs of development and construction  are also  capitalized.
     Capitalization  of interest and other carrying costs is discontinued when a
     project is substantially completed or if active development ceases.

(G)  LAND HELD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OR SALE
     Land held for future development or sale is carried at the lower of cost or
     fair value less costs to sell.

(H)  DEFERRED LOAN COSTS
     Costs  incurred to obtain loans have been deferred and are being  amortized
     over the terms of the related loans.

(I)  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
     The Company  reviews  income-producing  properties,  property,  plant,  and
     equipment,  land held for future development or sale, assets to be disposed
     of and certain intangible assets for impairment  whenever events or changes
     in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
     recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
     comparison  of the  carrying  amount of the asset to future  net cash flows
     expected to be  generated  by the asset.  If an asset is  considered  to be
     impaired,  the  impairment  to be  recognized  is measured by the amount by
     which the  carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds the  asset's  fair value.
     Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount
     or fair value less cost to sell.

(J)  INCOME TAXES
     Income  taxes are  accounted  for under  the  asset and  liability  method.
     Deferred  tax  assets and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the future tax
     consequences  attributable to differences  between the financial  statement
     carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities and their  respective
     tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are measured using enacted
     tax rates  expected to apply to taxable  income in the years in which those
     temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect
     of a  change  in tax  rates on  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  is
     recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(K)  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     Management believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
     receivables,  other assets, accounts payable,  accrued expenses and current
     portions of debt  instruments are reasonable  approximations  of their fair
     value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

     The fair value of the Company's  noncurrent portions of debt instruments is
     estimated by discounting  the future cash flows of each instrument at rates
     currently offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable
     maturities by the Company's bankers.  Based on this valuation  methodology,
     management  believes that the carrying amount of the noncurrent portions of
     debt instruments is a reasonable estimation of their fair value.

(L)  STOCK OPTIONS
     Prior to May 1, 1996,  the Company  accounted  for its stock option plan in
     accordance with the provisions of Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No.
     25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to Employees  ("APB  Opinion  25"),  and
     related interpretations. As such, compensation expense was recorded only to
     the extent  that the market  price of the  underlying  stock at the date of
     grant exceeded the exercise  price. On May 1, 1996, the Company adopted the
     provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123,
     Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation.  SFAS No. 123 encourages entities
     to  recognize  as  expense  over the  vesting  period the fair value of all
     stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows
     entities  to  continue  to  apply  the  provisions  of APB  Opinion  25 for
     recognizing  stock-based   compensation  expense  in  the  basic  financial
     statements.  Companies  not  following  the fair  value  based  method  are
     required to provide  expanded  disclosures  in the  footnotes.  The Company
     elected to continue to apply the  provisions  of APB Opinion 25 and provide
     the pro forma disclosure of SFAS No. 123.

(M)  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
     No.  130,  REPORTING   COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME.  This  statement  establishes
     standards  for  reporting  and  displaying  comprehensive  income  and  its
     components in a full set of general purpose financial statements.  SFAS No.
     130 requires all items that are required to be recognized  under accounting
     standards as components of comprehensive  income be reported in a financial
     statement that is displayed in equal  prominence  with the other  financial
     statements.  The term  "comprehensive  income" is used in the  statement to
     describe the total of all components of comprehensive  income including net
     income. "Other comprehensive income" refers to revenues,  expenses,  gains,
     and losses that are  included in  comprehensive  income but  excluded  from
     earnings under current accounting standards.  SFAS No. 130 is effective for
     financial  statements  for years  beginning  after  December 15, 1997.  The
     Company  adopted  SFAS No.  130  effective  May 1, 1998.  Adoption  of this
     statement  did not have an  impact  on the  Company's  financial  position,
     results of  operations  or liquidity,  as the  pronouncement  only requires
     additional  disclosure.  The Company did not have any  components  of other
     comprehensive  income in any of the periods  presented in the  accompanying
     financial statements.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131,  Disclosures  about Segments of
     an Enterprise and Related Information. This statement establishes standards
     for the way public  business  enterprises are to report  information  about
     operating  segments  in annual  financial  statements  and  requires  those
     enterprises to report selected  information about operating  segments using
     the  "management  approach"  concept.  It also  establishes  standards  for
     related  disclosures  about products and services,  geographic  areas,  and
     major  customers.  SFAS No. 131 is effective for financial  statements  for
     periods beginning after December 15, 1997. The Company adopted SFAS No. 131
     effective May 1, 1998.

(N)  RECLASSIFICATIONS
     Certain  reclassifications have been made to the 1998 and 1997 consolidated
     financial statements to conform with classifications adopted in 1999.

         During 1999, the Company  reclassified  its shopping  center located in
Newnan, Georgia, from income-producing properties to Property held for sale. The
shopping center was sold May 14, 1999 (note 14).

         During 1998, the Company sold  income-producing  properties  located in
Oakwood,  Georgia,  Newark, Ohio, and Tifton,  Georgia, and recognized gains for
financial  statement  purposes.   During  fiscal  year  1997,   income-producing
properties  located in Shawnee,  Oklahoma,  Warner Robins,  Georgia,  and Niles,
Michigan,  were also sold for gains. These sales transactions were structured as
tax-deferred,  like-kind  exchanges  pursuant to Internal  Revenue  Code Section
1031, which allows a deferral of the tax gain if the Company  utilizes  proceeds
of the sale to purchase other real estate within 180 days of sale.

         During the  fourth  quarter of fiscal  year 1997,  management  received
market  information  which it believed  indicated that the carrying value of its
shopping  center in North Fort Myers,  Florida,  had been  impaired.  Management
completed a  recoverability  review of the carrying value of the shopping center
based upon an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from
its use and eventual  disposition.  As of April 30, 1997,  management  concluded
that the sum of the undiscounted  future cash flows estimated to be generated by
the  shopping  center was less than the  carrying  value and,  as a result,  the
Company  recorded a provision for  impairment  of  $2,750,000  which reduced the
shopping center's carrying value to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair
value was determined by using market value studies  compiled by two  independent
commercial real estate brokerage firms. This shopping center is classified as an
Income-producing   property  in  the  accompanying   April  30,  1999  and  1998
consolidated balance sheets and is included in the Real Estate Segment.

was completed, the Company began depreciating the facility.

                      (8) MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE AND LEASES

         As of April 30,  1999,  the Company owns five  shopping  centers and an
office park which are pledged as collateral on related  mortgage  notes payable.
It is also lessee of nine shopping centers under leaseback arrangements expiring
from 2001 to 2014.  Each  mortgage note and  leaseback  arrangement  contains an
exculpatory  provision  limiting the Company's  liability to its interest in the
respective mortgaged property or lease.

         All of the leaseback  centers are leased to the Kmart  Corporation, and
Kmart is a  tenant  in five of the  seven  owned  shopping  centers.  The  owned
shopping centers are leased for periods expiring from fiscal years 2000 to 2040,
while  leases on the owned  office  properties  expire from fiscal years 2000 to
2003. Leases on the leaseback centers correspond to the leaseback  periods.  All
leases are operating  leases.  The shopping center leases typically require that
the tenant make fixed rental payments over a 5- to 25-year  period,  and provide
for renewal  options and for  contingent  rentals if the tenants'  sales volumes
exceed predetermined  amounts. In some cases, the shopping center leases provide
that the tenant bear the cost of insurance, repairs, maintenance and taxes. Base
rental  revenue  received from owned shopping  centers and office  properties in
1999, 1998, and 1997 was approximately $10,226,000,  $7,708,000, and $7,829,000,
respectively. Base rental revenue received from leaseback centers in 1999, 1998,
and 1997 was approximately $2,620,000, $2,620,000, and $2,694,000, respectively.
Contingent  rental revenue  received on all centers in 1999,  1998, and 1997 was
approximately $171,000, $195,000, and $164,000, respectively.

         Approximate  future  minimum  annual  rental  receipts  from all rental
properties are as follows:

         The outstanding principal balance of $228,564 and $457,136 at April 30,
1999 and 1998,  respectively,  on the industrial  development  bond payable have
been included in the current  maturities  of long-term  debt, as the former wood
manufacturing  facility securing this bond is included in Property held for sale
in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet at April 30, 1999 and 1998 (note
5).

         At  April  30,  1999,  the  Company  had  commitments  from a bank  for
unsecured  lines  of  credit  totaling  $12,000,000,  of  which  $7,600,000  was
outstanding.  An  additional  $500,000 was  restricted as it secures a letter of
credit described below.  These lines of credit,  which expire during fiscal year
2000,  bear interest at the prime rate (7.75% at April 30, 1999) and have a 3/8%
commitment fee on the unused portion. In addition, the Company had a commitment,
which  expires  during  fiscal year 2000,  for an unsecured  $1,000,000  line of
credit from a bank, of which none was  outstanding at April 30, 1999.  This line
of credit bears interest at the prime rate or at LIBOR (4.90% at April 30, 1999)
plus 2.7% and has a 3/8% commitment fee on the unused portion.  The Company also
had a commitment  for a line of credit,  which expires  during fiscal year 2000,
totaling  $2,500,000,  secured  by the  Manufacturing  Segment's  inventory  and
receivables,  of which  $448,222 was  outstanding at April 30, 1999. The secured
line of credit bears  interest at the prime rate or at LIBOR plus 2.7% and has a
3/10% commitment fee on the unused portion.

         The Company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements  related
to the $11,000,000  industrial  development revenue bonds shown above. The first
interest  rate swap  agreement was effective  February 4, 1998,  and  terminates
February 1, 2001. The notional amount reduces annually from $5.5 million, at the
effective  date,  to $5.3 million  prior to  expiration  of the  agreement.  The
agreement  requires  the  Company to pay a fixed rate of 5.57% in  exchange  for
floating rate payments  based on the 30-day  Non-financial  AA Commercial  Paper
rate (4.79% at April 30, 1999).

         The second interest rate swap agreement was effective February 4, 1998,
and terminates  February 1, 2003. The notional amount reduces annually from $5.5
million at the  effective  date to  $5,057,500  prior to the  expiration  of the
agreement.  The interest rate terms of the second agreement are identical to the
terms of the first  except that the fixed  interest  rate paid by the Company is
5.67%.  The  notional  amounts  of the  swap  agreements  are set to  match  the
outstanding  principal  amounts of the bonds.  The swap floating rates are reset
weekly, and the Company settles with the counterparty monthly.

         In connection with the issuance of the industrial  development  revenue
bonds, the Company was required to obtain an irrevocable letter of credit in the
amount of  $11,162,740.  The letter of credit was issued  November 12, 1997, and
expires on November  15,  2002.  The letter of credit can be extended  for three
additional  five-year  terms.  The letter of credit is guaranteed by the Company
and a subsidiary of the Company.  The letter of credit  contains  covenants that
require the maintenance of certain  financial  ratios. As of April 30, 1999, the
Company was in  compliance  with all debt  covenants or has obtained  waivers in
cases of non-compliance.

         In addition,  in conjunction  with the  origination of a mortgage on an
income-producing  property, the Company obtained an irrevocable,  standby letter
of credit in the amount of $500,000.  The letter of credit was originally issued
on July 30, 1997,  and amended  during August 1998.  The amendment  extended the
maturity  date to November 30, 1999.  The mortgage  lender is allowed to draw on
the letter in order to paydown  the  related  mortgage  loan if certain  leasing
requirements are not met. The letter of credit is secured by a portion of a bank
line of credit, discussed above.

         The operating  segments are managed  separately  and maintain  separate
personnel due to the differing  products offered by each segment.  Management of
each of the segments  evaluates  and monitors  the  performance  of the segments
based  on the  earnings  or  losses  prior  to  income  taxes.  The  significant
accounting  policies  utilized by the  operating  segments are the same as those
summarized in note 2 to the accompanying financial statements of the Company.

         Total  revenue  by  operating   segment  includes  both  revenues  from
unaffiliated  customers, as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of
operations,  and intersegment revenues, which are generally at prices negotiated
between segments.

         Segment  assets are those that are used in the Company's  operations in
each  segment,  including  receivables  due  from  other  segments.  The  Parent
Company's segment assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, cash surrender
value of life insurance, and receivables.

         Operating  (loss)  earnings is total revenue less  operating  expenses,
including   depreciation   and   interest.   Selling,   shipping,   general  and
administrative  and interest  costs,  deducted in the  computation  of operating
(loss)  earnings of each segment,  represent  the actual costs  incurred by that
segment.  Parent  expenses and income taxes have not been allocated to the other
subsidiaries.

         The  Company  had  revenues  from  The  Home  Depot,  Inc.,   primarily
representing revenues in the Construction Segment, aggregating 53%, 61%, and 51%
of consolidated revenues in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

<TEXT>

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS  AGREEMENT  is made and  entered  into as of the 18th day of  November
1998,  by and  between  ABRAMS  INDUSTRIES,  INC.,  a Georgia  corporation  (the
"Company"), and EDWARD M. ABRAMS ("Executive").

                            W I T N E S S E T H:
                            -------------------

     WHEREAS, Executive has devoted over forty-five years of valuable service to
the Company  and has during  such time  accumulated  significant  knowledge  and
understanding of the Company's operations,  markets,  industries,  suppliers and
employees, to which knowledge the Company desires to have long-term access;

     WHEREAS,  the  parties  hereto  desire to enter into an  agreement  for the
employment of Executive by the Company on the terms and  conditions  hereinafter
stated;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  for and in  consideration  of the premises and the mutual
covenants  and  agreements   contained  herein,  and  other  good  and  valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   Employment, Duties and Term.  (a)  Subject to the terms and
          ---------------------------
conditions  of  this  Agreement,  the  Company  hereby  employs  Executive,  and
Executive  hereby accepts such  employment.  Executive  shall serve initially as
Chairman of the Executive Committee, and shall perform such duties and functions
for the Company as are  customarily  incident to such  position.  Executive  may
serve in other mutually agreeable positions with the Company during the Term (as
defined below). To facilitate the performance of such duties and functions,  the
Company will provide  Executive  with  reasonable  office space and  secretarial
assistance.

          (b)  Unless  earlier   terminated  as  provided  herein,   Executive's
employment  under this Agreement shall be for a term commencing as of August 19,
1998 (the  "Effective  Date") and ending on August 19,  2008.  The date on which
Executive's employment terminates as provided in this Agreement is herein called
the  "Termination  Date",  and the period from the  Effective  Date  through the
Termination Date is herein called the "Term".

          (c)  Executive  shall not,  without the prior  written  consent of the
Company,  directly or  indirectly,  at any time  during the Term,  engage in any
venture or activity which is competitive  with or adverse to the business of the
Company,  whether alone,  as a partner,  or as an officer,  director,  employee,
consultant, shareholder of a non-publicly held company, or otherwise.

     2.   Compensation.  In  consideration  of Executive'  services  hereunder,
          ------------
Company  shall  pay  to  Executive   compensation  as  set  forth  below  (which
compensation  shall be paid, except as otherwise  provided herein, in accordance
with the normal compensation practices of the  Company and shall be  subject to

<PAGE>
such deductions and  withholdings as are required by law or general  policies of
the Company in effect from time to time):

          (a) The Company shall pay to Executive an annual salary which shall be
paid on a weekly  basis  and  shall  initially  be  $231,525  per  annum  ("Base
Compensation").  On each  anniversary of the Effective Date,  Base  Compensation
shall be increased by five percent (5%) over the Base  Compensation for the year
preceding such anniversary.

          (b) The Company shall pay those  membership dues and  subscriptions on
behalf of Executive as are currently  provided to Executive by the Company,  and
as are provided to executive officers of the Company from time to time.

          (c)  Executive  shall be entitled  to the medical and dental  benefits
that are provided from time to time by the Company's  medical insurance plan and
dental  insurance  plan.  Such  medical  benefits  may also be provided  through
Medicare coverage available to Executive or supplemental medical insurance, or a
combination  of both, so long as the benefits  provided to Executive and the out
of pocket costs incurred by Executive are  substantially  the same as those that
would be  provided  and  incurred  by  Executive  under  the  Company's  medical
insurance plan.

          (d) Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Profit
Sharing  Plan on the  same  basis as other  employees  for so long as  Executive
continues  to work the annual  minimum  number of hours  during each fiscal year
necessary to qualify as an eligible  participant in the Company's Profit Sharing
Plan. If in any fiscal year Executive fails to work the annual minimum number of
hours  necessary to qualify as an eligible  participant in the Company's  Profit
Sharing Plan,  then  thereafter  the Company shall pay to Executive  each fiscal
year an  amount  all in cash  that is  equal  to the  total  cash  and  deferred
payments,  if any,  which would have been paid or credited to Executive for that
fiscal year had he been an eligible  participant in the Company's Profit Sharing
Plan.

          (e) Executive  shall be entitled to  participate in any other employee
benefit plans generally provided by the Company to its executive  officers,  but
only if and to the extent  provided in such  employee  benefit  plans and for so
long as the Company  provides  or offers such  benefit  plans.  For  purposes of
determining his eligibility to participate in such other employee benefit plans,
Executive shall be deemed a regular full-time salaried employee.

          (f) The  compensation  and  benefits set forth above in this Section 2
shall cease on the Termination Date, except amounts payable for any period prior
to the  Termination  Date and except as required by law or the express  terms of
any  employee  benefit plan in which  Executive  participates  pursuant  hereto.
Nothing  herein shall affect  Executive's  right to COBRA  benefits,  Short-Term
Disability Plan benefits and Long-Term Disability Plan benefits,  nor affect the
rights of beneficiaries  under any life insurance policies insuring  Executive's
life.

     3.   Confidential Information.  (a)  During the Term, Executive agrees
          ------------------------
that he shall not disclose to any person, or otherwise use, except in connection
with and as necessary  for his duties  performed  for the  Company,  any Company
Confidential Information; provided, however, that Executive may

<PAGE>
make  disclosures  required by a valid  order or  subpoena  issued by a court or
administrative agency of competent  jurisdiction,  in which event Executive will
promptly  notify the Company of such order or subpoena to provide the Company an
opportunity to protect its interests.

          (b) "Company  Confidential  Information,"  as used in this  Agreement,
means  information  relating to the business of the Company which derives value,
actual or potential,  from not being generally  known to other persons.  Company
Confidential  Information does not include  information  which becomes generally
known to the public without breach of this Agreement.

     4.   Termination.  Executive's employment under this Agreement may be
          -----------
terminated only in accordance with the following provisions:

          (a) Executive's  employment hereunder shall be deemed to be terminated
as of  the  date  of  Executive's  death.  In the  event  of  Executive's  total
disability,   the  Executive's  employment  hereunder  shall  be  deemed  to  be
terminated  on the second August 19th  following  the date of total  disability,
except that in no event shall this contract extend beyond August 19, 2008.

          (b) The Company may  terminate  Executive's  employment  hereunder for
"Cause," which shall mean (i) Executive's gross negligence or willful misconduct
in the performance of his duties hereunder which results in material harm to the
Company,  or (ii)  Executive's  conviction of a felony or crime  involving moral
turpitude.  A  termination  of  Executive  with Cause based on clause (i) of the
preceding  sentence  shall take effect 90 days after the Company  gives  written
notice of such  termination to Executive  unless  Executive  shall,  during such

                                 REPRESENTATIONS

         SECTION  2.1.  REPRESENTATIONS  BY THE  ISSUER.  The  Issuer  makes the
following  representations  as the basis for the undertakings on its part herein
contained:

         (a)  ORGANIZATION.  The Issuer is a public body  corporate and politic,
created and validly  existing  pursuant to the provisions of the Act. The Issuer
has been activated as required by the terms of the Development  Authorities law,
its directors have been appointed as provided  therein and are currently  acting
in that capacity,  and a copy of said activating  resolution has been filed with
the  Secretary  of State of the State of Georgia as required by law.  The Issuer
has been created to develop and promote for the public good and general  welfare
trade,  commerce,  industry  and  employment  opportunities  and to promote  the
general welfare of the State of Georgia. The aforementioned  authorities empower
the  Issuer  to issue its  revenue  bonds,  in  accordance  with the  applicable
provisions  of the Revenue Bond Law of the State of Georgia (Ga.  Laws 1937,  p.
761, ET SEQ.), as heretofore or hereafter amended, for the purpose of acquiring,
constructing  and  installing  any  project (as defined in the Act) for lease or
sale to prospective  tenants or purchasers in furtherance of the public purposes
for which it was created.

         (b) AUTHORITY.  The Issuer has all requisite  power and authority under
the Act to (i) issue the Bonds,  (ii) to assist the Lessee in financing the cost
of acquiring,  constructing and equipping the Project, and (iii) enter into, and
perform its obligations under the Issuer Documents.

         (c)  PENDING  LITIGATION.  There are no  actions,  suits,  proceedings,
inquiries  or  investigations  pending,  or  to  the  knowledge  of  the  Issuer
threatened,  against  or  affecting  the  Issuer  in any  court  or  before  any
governmental  authority  or  arbitration  board or tribunal,  which  involve the
possibility of materially and adversely affecting the transactions  contemplated
by the Issuer  Documents or which,  in any way,  would  materially and adversely
affect the validity or  enforceability of the Bonds, the Issuer Documents or any
agreement  or  instrument  to which  the  Issuer is a party and which is used or
contemplated for use in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

         (d) ISSUE,  SALE AND OTHER  TRANSACTIONS ARE LEGAL AND AUTHORIZED.  The
issuance and sale of the Bonds and the  execution  and delivery by the Issuer of
the  Issuer  Documents,  and  the  compliance  by  the  Issuer  with  all of the
provisions of each thereof and of the Bonds (i) are within the purposes,  powers
and  authority of the Issuer,  (ii) have been done in full  compliance  with the
provisions of the Act, are legal and will not conflict with or constitute on the
part of the Issuer a violation of or a breach of or default under,  or result in
the creation of any lien,  charge or encumbrance upon any property of the Issuer
(other than as  contemplated  in the  Indenture)  under the  provisions  of, any
activating  resolution,   by-law,  indenture,  mortgage,  deed  of  trust,  note
agreement or other  agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by
which the Issuer is bound,  or to the best of Issuer's  knowledge  any  license,
judgment,  decree,  law,  statute,  order,  rule or  regulation  of any court or
governmental  agency or body having  jurisdiction  over the Issuer or any of its
activities or properties,  and (iii) have been duly  authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Issuer.

         (e) GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS.  Neither the nature of the Issuer nor any of
its activities or properties,  nor any  relationship  between the Issuer and any
other  person,  nor any  circumstance  in  connection  with the  issue,  sale or
delivery  of any of the Bonds is such as to require  the  consent,  approval  or
authorization  of,  or the  filing,  registration  or  qualification  with,  any
governmental  authority  on the  part  of the  Issuer  in  connection  with  the
execution,  delivery and performance of the Issuer Documents or the issue,  sale
or delivery of the Bonds, other than those already obtained;  provided, however,
no  representation is made as to compliance with any federal or state securities
or "blue sky" law.

         (f) NO  DEFAULTS.  To the best of  Issuer's  knowledge,  no  event  has
occurred  and no  condition  exists  with  respect  to the  Issuer  which  would
constitute  an "event of default" as defined in any of the Issuer  Documents  or
which, with the lapse of time or with the giving of notice or both, would become
such an "event of default."  The Issuer is not in default under the Act or under
any charter instrument, by-law or other agreement or instrument to which it is a
party  or by  which  it is  bound  which  default  would  adversely  affect  the
enforceability or taxability of the Bonds.

                                       5



<PAGE>

         (g) NO PRIOR  PLEDGE.  Neither  this  Agreement  nor any of the Pledged
Revenues  have been  pledged or  hypothecated  in any manner or for any  purpose
other than as  provided  in the  Indenture  as  security  for the payment of the
Bonds.

         (h) NATURE AND LOCATION OF PROJECT.  The  financing of the costs of the
Project,  together with related  expenses,  is  authorized  under the Act, is in
furtherance  of the public  purpose  for which the Issuer was  created  and will
increase employment in the area served by the Issuer.

         (i) LIMITED OBLIGATIONS.  Notwithstanding  anything herein contained to
the  contrary,  any  obligation  the Issuer may hereby  incur for the payment of
money shall not constitute an  indebtedness  of the County or of the State or of
any political subdivision thereof within the meaning of any state constitutional
provision  or  statutory  limitation  and  shall  not give  rise to a  pecuniary
liability of the State or the County or any political  subdivision  thereof,  or
constitute a charge  against the general credit or taxing power of said State or
County or any political subdivision thereof, but shall be limited obligations of
the Issuer payable solely from (i) the Pledged  Revenues,  (ii) revenues derived
from the sale of the Bonds,  and (iii)  amounts on deposit  from time to time in
the Bond Fund,  subject to the  provisions  of this  Agreement and the Indenture
permitting  the  application  thereof  for the  purposes  and on the  terms  and
conditions  set forth herein and  therein.  No officer or director of the Issuer
shall be personally liable on this Agreement or any of the Issuer Documents. The
Issuer has no taxing power.

         SECTION 2.2. NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY BY ISSUER AS TO PROJECT. The
Issuer makes no  representation  or warranty  concerning the  suitability of the
Project  for the  purpose for which it is being  undertaken  by the Lessee.  The
Issuer has not made any independent  investigation  as to the feasibility of the
Project or creditworthiness  of the Lessee, and any bond purchaser,  assignee of
the  Agreement  or any other party with any interest in this  transaction  shall
make its own independent  investigation as to the creditworthiness of the Lessee
and feasibility of the Project,  independent of any representation or warranties
of the Issuer.

         SECTION  2.3.  REPRESENTATIONS  BY THE  LESSEE.  The  Lessee  makes the
following  representations  as the basis for the undertakings on its part herein
contained:

         (a)  ORGANIZATION  AND POWER.  The  Lessee  (i) is a limited  liability
company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Georgia,  and (ii) has all  requisite  power and  authority and all
necessary  licenses  and  permits  to own its  properties  and to  carry  on its
business as now being conducted and as presently  proposed to be conducted,  and
(iii)  has  the  power  to  enter  into  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions
contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder.

         (b) PENDING  LITIGATION.  There are no proceedings  pending,  or to the
knowledge of the Lessee threatened, against or affecting the Lessee in any court
or before any  governmental  authority,  arbitration  board or tribunal which if
adversely  determined,  would  materially and adversely  affect the transactions
contemplated  by the Lessee  Documents or the  Indenture  or which,  in any way,
would  materially  and adversely  affect the  properties,  business,  prospects,
profits or condition  (financial or otherwise) of the Lessee,  or the ability of
the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Lessee Documents.  The Lessee is
not in default  with respect to an order of any court,  governmental  authority,
arbitration board or tribunal.

         (c) AGREEMENTS ARE LEGAL AND AUTHORIZED.  The execution and delivery by
the Lessee of each of the Lessee Documents and the compliance by the Lessee with
all of the provisions  hereof and thereof (i) are within the power of the Lessee
as a limited  liability  company,  (ii) will not conflict  with or result in any
breach of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under,  or result in
the creation of any lien,  charge or encumbrance upon any property of the Lessee
under the  provisions  of, any  agreement,  articles of  organization,  by-laws,
operating  agreement  or other  instrument  to which the Lessee is a party or by
which it may be bound, or any license,  judgment,  decree, law, statute,  order,
rule  or  regulation  of  any  court  or  governmental  agency  or  body  having
jurisdiction  over the Lessee or any of its activities or properties,  and (iii)
have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate  action on the part of the
Lessee.

                                       6



<PAGE>

         (d) GOVERNMENTAL CONSENT. Neither the Lessee nor any of its business or
properties,  nor any relationship  between the Lessee and any other person,  nor
any circumstances in connection with the execution,  delivery and performance by
the Lessee of the Lessee Documents or the offer,  issue, sale or delivery by the
Issuer  of  the  Bonds,  is  such  as  to  require  the  consent,   approval  or
authorization  of,  or the  filing,  registration  or  qualification  with,  any
governmental  authority  on the part of the  Lessee  other  than  those  already
obtained;  provided, however, that no representation is made as to any consents,
approvals or  authorizations  required in connection  with the  construction  or
occupancy of the Project.

         (e) NO DEFAULTS.  No event has  occurred  and no condition  exists with
respect to the Lessee that would  constitute an "event of default"  under any of
the  Lessee  Documents  or which,  with the lapse of time or with the  giving of
notice or both,  would become such an "event of  default."  The Lessee is not in
violation in any material  respect of any  articles of  organization,  operating
agreement  or  other  instrument  to  which  it is a party or by which it may be
bound.

         (f) COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. The Lessee is not in violation in any material
way of any laws,  ordinances,  governmental  rules or regulations to which it is
subject and has not failed to obtain any licenses,  permits, franchises or other
governmental  authorizations  necessary to the ownership of its properties or to
the  conduct of its  business,  which  business  consists  solely of leasing and
subleasing the Project,  which  violation or failure to obtain might  materially
and adversely affect the properties,  business, prospects, profits or conditions
(financial or otherwise) of the Lessee.

         (g)  RESTRICTIONS  ON THE  LESSEE.  The  Lessee  is not a party  to any
contract or agreement that materially and adversely  affects the business of the
Lessee.  Except  for the  Credit  Agreement,  the  Lessee  is not a party to any
contract or agreement that restricts the right or ability of the Lessee to incur
or guarantee indebtedness for borrowed money.

         (h)  INDUCEMENT.   The  issuance  of  the  Bonds  by  the  Issuer,  the
acquisition,  construction  and  equipping  of the Project by the Issuer and the
leasing of the  Project by the Issuer to the Lessee  have  induced the Lessee to
locate the Project in the County.  The issuance of the Bonds by the Issuer,  the
acquisition,  construction  and  equipping  of the Project by the Issuer and the
leasing of the  Project by the Issuer to the Lessee  shall  assist the Lessee in
providing employment and industry in the County.

         (i) ESTIMATED TIME OF COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT.  The Lessee  estimates
that the Project will be completed and ready for occupancy by November 1, 1998.

         (j)  LOCATION OF PROJECT.  The Project is located  entirely  within the
geographical boundaries of the County.

          SECTION 3.1. LEASE OF THE PROJECT; AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, CONSTRUCT AND
EQUIP THE PROJECT.

         (a) The Issuer  hereby  leases to the  Lessee,  and the  Lessee  hereby
leases  from the  Issuer,  the  Project at the  rental set forth in Section  4.2
hereof and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

         (b)  The  Issuer  has   appointed   the  Lessee  to  proceed  with  the
acquisition,  construction and equipping of the Project, as described in Exhibit
A. The Lessee has  obtained or has caused to be obtained all  licenses,  permits
and consents  required for the  acquisition,  construction  and equipping of the
Project,  obtainable  to date and has no reason to believe it cannot  obtain all
other permits when needed.  The Issuer shall have no responsibility for any such
permits.

         (c) The Issuer agrees that the Building will consist of a manufacturing
facility  which is  described  on Exhibit  A-1 and shall be the  property of the
Issuer  and  subject  to the terms of this  Agreement  and the  other  Permitted
Exceptions.

         (d) The  Lessee  will not take any  action  or fail to take any  action
which would adversely affect the qualification of the Project under the Act.

         SECTION  3.2.  AGREEMENT  TO  ISSUE  BONDS;  APPLICATION  OF  PROCEEDS;
CONSTRUCTION  FUND.  In order to  provide  funds for  payment of the Cost of the
Project, the Issuer shall simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof,
authorize,  validate, sell and cause to be delivered to the initial purchaser or
purchasers  thereof,  the Bonds,  bearing  interest and maturing as set forth in
Article II of the Indenture,  at a price to be approved by the Lessee and Credit
Issuer.  The  moneys  in the  Construction  Fund  shall be used to  finance  the
acquiring,  constructing  and equipping of the Project and for paying certain of
the costs of issuing the Bonds. The obligation of the Issuer to pay for the Cost
of the Project shall be limited to the proceeds in the Construction Fund derived
from the sale of the Bonds in accordance with the Indenture.

         SECTION 3.3.  ESTABLISHMENT  OF COMPLETION  DATE. The  Completion  Date
shall be  evidenced to the Issuer and the Trustee by a  certificate  in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C, signed by a Lessee Representative  stating (a) the
Cost of Project,  (b) that the  acquisition,  construction  and equipping of the
Project have been completed  substantially  in accordance  with Section 3.1, and
(c) that, except for amounts retained by the Trustee for the Cost of Project not
then  due  and  payable,  if any,  the  full  Cost of  Project  has  been  paid.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  such  certificate  shall state that it is given
without prejudice to any rights against third parties which exist at the date of
such certificate or which may subsequently come into being.

         SECTION  3.4.  LESSEE  REQUIRED TO COMPLETE  PROJECT.  If the  proceeds
derived from the sale of the Bonds issued for such purpose are not sufficient to
pay in full  the  Cost of  Project,  the  Lessee  shall  pay so much of the cost
thereof  as may be in excess  of the  proceeds  of the Bonds and any  investment
income thereon available  therefor.  The Lessee agrees that if, after exhaustion
of the  proceeds  derived  from  the sale of the  Bonds  and  investment  income
thereon,  the Lessee  should pay any portion of the Cost of Project  pursuant to
the  provisions of this Section,  it shall not be entitled to any  reimbursement
therefor  from  the  Issuer  or the  Trustee  nor  shall it be  entitled  to any
abatement, diminution or postponement of its rental payments hereunder.

         SECTION 3.5.  LIMITATION OF ISSUER'S  LIABILITY.  Anything contained in
this  Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding,  any obligation the Issuer may
incur in connection with the undertaking of the Project for the payment of money
shall not be deemed to  constitute a debt or general  obligation  of the Issuer,
the State or any political subdivision thereof, but shall be payable solely from
the rents,  revenues and receipts  derived by it from this  Agreement,  and from
payments made pursuant to the Credit Facility. No provision in this Agreement or
any obligation  herein  imposed upon the Issuer,  or the breach  thereof,  shall

                                       8




<PAGE>

constitute or give rise to or impose upon the Issuer,  the County,  the State or
any  political  subdivision  thereof a pecuniary  liability or a charge upon its
general  credit or taxing  powers.  No officer or member of the Issuer  shall be
personally liable on this Agreement or any of the Issuer Documents.

         SECTION 3.6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. The Lessee recognizes that since
the  Project has been or will be  acquired,  constructed  and  equipped by or on
behalf of the Lessee or the Sublessee on behalf of the Issuer and by contractors
and suppliers  selected by the Lessee or the  Sublessee,  NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR
THE TRUSTEE  MAKES ANY  REPRESENTATION  OR  WARRANTY,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  WITH
RESPECT TO THE  MERCHANTABILITY,  CONDITION  OR  WORKMANSHIP  OF ANY PART OF THE
PROJECT OR ITS SUITABILITY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LESSEE OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH
PROCEEDS  DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE BONDS WILL PAY THE COST TO BE INCURRED IN
CONNECTION THEREWITH.

         SECTION 3.7.  PAYMENTS FROM  CONSTRUCTION  FUND.  The Trustee shall use
moneys in the  Construction  Fund solely to pay the Cost of Project.  Before any
payment shall be made from the Construction  Fund, there shall be filed with the
Trustee:

         (a) A requisition,  in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, signed by
a Lessee  Representative  and  approved  in  writing by an officer of the Credit
Issuer,  stating to whom the payment is to be made,  the amount of payment,  the
purpose in reasonable  detail for which the  obligation to be paid was incurred,
and that the  obligation  stated on the  requisition  has been  incurred  by the
Lessee in or about the  acquisition,  construction  or equipping of the Project,
each item is a proper charge  against the  Construction  Fund and the obligation
has not been the basis for a prior  requisition  which has been  paid,  together
with  a  certificate  attached  to  such  requisition  and  signed  by a  Lessee
Representative stating that:

               (1)    there has been  received  no  written  notice of any lien,
                      right to lien or attachment  upon, or claim  affecting the
                      right  of the  payee to  receive  payment  of,  any of the
                      moneys  payable  under  such  requisition  to  any  of the
                      persons, firms, or corporation named therein;

               (2)    such requisition contains no items representing payment on
                      account of any  percentage  entitled to be retained at the
                      date of the certificate; and

               (3)    no Event of Default  hereunder  or under the  Indenture or
                      event  which  after  notice or lapse of time or both would
                      constitute  an Event of  Default  hereunder  or under  the
                      Indenture has occurred and not been waived or cured.

         (b)  An  invoice  or  other  appropriate  evidence  of  the  obligation
described in the requisition required by subsection (a) above.

         Upon receipt of each such requisition and accompanying certificate, the
Trustee shall make payment from the  Construction  Fund in accordance  with such
requisition.

         SECTION 3.8.  INVESTMENT OF FUNDS.  Any moneys held in the Bond Fund or
the  Construction  Fund or any other fund created under the  Indenture  shall be
invested  or  reinvested  by the  Trustee  as set forth in  Section  4.07 of the
Indenture,  to the extent permitted by law, or in the Permitted  Investments (as
defined in the  Indenture),  at the telephonic or oral  direction  (confirmed in
writing) of the Lessee  Representative.  All such investments shall at all times
be a part of the fund (the  Construction  Fund, the Bond Fund or such other fund
created under the  Indenture,  as the case may be) from where the moneys used to
acquire  such  investments  shall have come,  and all income and profits on such
investments  shall be credited to, and losses thereon shall be charged  against,
such fund.

         SECTION 3.9.  DEPOSITORIES  OF MONEYS AND  SECURITY  FOR  DEPOSIT.  All
moneys  received  by the Issuer in  connection  with the  issuance  of the Bonds
(other than for its fees and  expenses)  shall be deposited in the  Construction
Fund created under the Indenture.  All such moneys deposited shall be applied in
accordance with the terms and for the purposes herein set forth and shall not be
subject to lien or attachment by any creditor of the Issuer.

         SECTION 3.10.  WARRANTY OF TITLE. The Issuer for itself, its successors
and  assigns,  based  solely on the Title  Insurance  Policy to be  delivered by
Commonwealth  Land  Title  Insurance  Company,  represents  that it has good and
marketable fee simple title in and to the Leased Land free from all encumbrances
except Permitted Exceptions.  Upon the execution and delivery of this Lease, the
Issuer  agrees  that it will  furnish to the  Lessee an opinion of the  Issuer's
Counsel given in reliance on the Title Insurance Policy, stating that the Issuer
holds such title in and to the Leased Land.

         SECTION 3.11. QUIET  ENJOYMENT.  The Issuer warrants and covenants that
it will defend the Lessee at the  Lessee's  expense  (except as to claims by the
Issuer) in the quiet enjoyment and peaceable  possession of the Leased Land, and
all  appurtenances  thereto  belonging,  including the  Building,  free from all
claims of all persons  whomsoever,  throughout  the Lease  Term,  so long as the
Lessee shall perform the covenants, conditions and agreements to be performed by
it hereunder,  or so long as the period for remedying any failure of performance
shall not have expired.

                             PROVISIONS FOR PAYMENT

         SECTION 4.1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT;  DURATION OF LEASE TERM;
DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE OF POSSESSION.

         (a) This  Agreement  shall become  effective  upon its delivery and the
leasehold  interest created by this Agreement shall then begin,  and, subject to
the other  provisions of this Agreement,  shall expire at midnight on October 1,
2018.

         (b) The  Issuer  agrees to deliver  to the  Lessee  sole and  exclusive
possession of the Project  (subject to the right of the Trustee to enter thereon
for inspection  purposes and to other provisions  hereof) on the date of initial
issuance of the Bonds and the Lessee hereby accepts possession of the Project.

         SECTION 4.2. RENTS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE.

         (a) The Lessee agrees (i) except as provided in subsection  (b) of this
Section,  to make prompt payment to the Trustee,  as assignee and pledgee of the
Issuer,  and as rent for the Project,  for deposit in the Bond Fund, the amounts
which are necessary to pay the principal and Purchase Price of, premium, if any,
or interest on the Bonds (whether at maturity,  upon redemption or acceleration,
or  otherwise)  when and as the same shall be due and  payable.  All such rental
payments shall be made to the Trustee at its principal office in lawful money of
the  United  States  of  America,  except as may be  otherwise  agreed to by the
Trustee.

         (b) In order to provide for the rental payments  required in subsection
(a) of this  Section,  the Lessee  shall cause the Credit  Issuer to deliver the
Credit  Facility  to the  Trustee  simultaneously  with the  original  issue and
delivery  of the Bonds,  and hereby  authorizes  and directs the Trustee to draw
moneys  under the Credit  Facility  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the
Indenture to the extent necessary to make the payments of principal and purchase
price of, and  interest on the Bonds as and when the same become due. The Lessee
shall receive as a credit against its rental obligations described in subsection
(a) of this  Section all  payments  made by the Credit  Issuer  under the Credit
Facility and all other amounts described in Section 3.08(a) of the Indenture.

         (c) If the  Lessee  should  fail to  make  any of the  rental  payments
required in subsection  (a) and (b) above,  the rental  payment which the Lessee
has failed to make shall  continue as an obligation of the Lessee until the same
shall have been fully paid,  and the Lessee agrees to pay the same with interest
thereon at the rate per annum borne by the Bonds until paid in full.

         (d) In  addition,  the Lessee  agrees to pay any costs of  issuing  the
Bonds that are not paid with the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds by depositing
the same with the  Trustee.  Said monies  shall be  disbursed  by the Trustee in
accordance with written instructions from the Lessee.

         (e) Anything  herein,  in the Indenture or in the Bonds to the contrary
notwithstanding, the obligations of the Lessee hereunder shall be subject to the
limitation that payments  constituting  interest under this Section shall not be
required  to the extent  that the  receipt of such  payment by the holder of any
Bond would be contrary to the  provisions of law applicable to such holder which
limit the maximum  rate of interest  which may be charged or  collected  by such
holder.

         SECTION 4.3.   CREDIT FACILITY; ALTERNATE CREDIT FACILITY.

         (a) The Credit Facility  delivered to the Trustee  simultaneously  with
the  original  issuance  and delivery of the Bonds  constitutes  an  irrevocable
obligation  of the Credit  Issuer to pay to the  Trustee,  upon  request  and in
accordance  with the terms thereof,  up to an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
principal  amount of the Bonds  then  outstanding  plus (ii) an amount  equal to
interest for 36 days on the principal  amount of each Bond then  outstanding  at
the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum.

<PAGE>

         (b) The Lessee  shall have the option  from time to time to provide the
Trustee with an Alternate  Credit  Facility in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.08(e) of the Indenture. If at any time there shall have been delivered
to the Trustee an Alternate Credit  Facility,  together with the other documents
and  opinions  required by Section  3.08(e) of the  Indenture,  then the Trustee
shall  accept  such  Alternate  Credit  Facility  and  promptly   surrender  the
previously  held Credit  Facility to the issuer  thereof  for  cancellation,  in
accordance  with the terms of such Credit  Facility.  If at any time there shall
cease to be any  Bonds  outstanding  under  the  Indenture,  the  Trustee  shall
promptly surrender the Credit Facility to the issuer thereof, in accordance with
the terms of such Credit Facility,  for  cancellation.  The Trustee shall comply
with the procedures set forth in the Credit Facility relating to the termination
thereof.

         SECTION 4.4.  ADDITIONAL  RENT. The Lessee shall also pay as Additional
Rent  hereunder,  to the persons  entitled  thereto,  until the principal of and
interest  on the Bonds shall have been fully paid or  provision  for the payment
thereof shall have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture:
(i) the  fees  and  charges  of the  Trustee  incurred  in  connection  with the
rendering  of its  ordinary  and  extraordinary  services  as Trustee  under the
Indenture,  as and when the same become due,  including the reasonable  fees and
expenses of its Counsel, (ii) the fees and expenses of the Remarketing Agent for
serving as Remarketing  Agent for the Bonds,  including the reasonable  fees and
expenses  of  its  Counsel,  and  any  other  amounts  due  and  payable  to the
Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing  Agreement,  (iii) the fees and expenses
of the Rating Agency for issuing and  maintaining  its securities  rating on the
Bonds,   if  any,  (iv)  [the  Issuer's   Fee,]  the   out-of-pocket   expenses,
administrative expenses and Counsel fees of the Issuer and Bond Counsel, (v) all
utility rents and charges  incurred in  connection  with the Project or any part
thereof,  (vi)  charges  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of the  Project,
including, but not limited to, sanitation,  repair, electricity,  gas, security,
and other items deemed necessary for the efficient operation of the Project, and
(vii) any and all taxes and assessments or other governmental  charges which may
be lawfully taxed,  charged,  levied or assessed against the Project or any part
thereof or the revenues derived therefrom including any new taxes and assessment
not of the kind enumerated  above to the extent that the same are lawfully made,
levied,  charged or assessed  in lieu of or in addition to taxes or  assessments
now customarily levied against real or personal property,  and further including
all water and sewer charges,  assessments and other general governmental charges
and impositions whatsoever,  foreseen or unforeseen,  which if not paid when due
would impair the  security of the Bonds or encumber  the  Issuer's  title to the
Project.  The Lessee may, without  constituting  grounds for an Event of Default
hereunder,  withhold  payment of any such fees and  charges of the  Trustee,  to
contest  in good  faith the  necessity  for any  extraordinary  services  of the
Trustee and the reasonableness of any extraordinary  expenses of the Trustee. If
the Lessee should fail to make any payment of  Additional  Rent required in this
Section,  the Additional Rent which the Lessee has failed to make shall continue
as an obligation  of the Lessee until the same shall have been fully paid,  with
interest thereon at the rate per annum borne by the Bonds until paid in full.

         SECTION 4.5.  OBLIGATIONS  OF THE LESSEE  ABSOLUTE  AND  UNCONDITIONAL.
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 hereof,  the  obligations of the Lessee
to make or to cause  (pursuant  to the  Credit  Facility)  to be made the rental
payments  required in Sections  4.2 and 4.4 and to perform and observe the other
agreements on its part contained herein shall be absolute and  unconditional and
shall not be  subject to  diminution  by  set-off,  counterclaim,  abatement  or
otherwise by reason of any action or inaction of the Trustee,  the Issuer or any
third party. Until such time as the principal of, and the interest on, the Bonds
shall have been paid in full, the Lessee (a) will not suspend or discontinue any
rental  payments  provided  for in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 except to the extent the
same have been  prepaid,  (b) will perform and observe all its other  agreements
contained herein,  and (c) except as provided in Article VII, will not terminate
this Agreement for any cause, including,  without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,   any  acts  or   circumstances   that  may  constitute   failure  of
consideration,  sale, loss, eviction or constructive eviction, destruction of or
damage to the Project,  condemnation,  commercial  frustration  of purpose,  any
change in the tax or other laws of the United  States of America or of the State
or any political  subdivision of either, or any failure of the Issuer to perform
and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or any duty, liability or
obligation  arising  out of or in  connection  herewith  or with the  Indenture.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  obligation of the Lessee to make payments
hereunder shall be satisfied and discharged to the extent moneys are received by
the Trustee pursuant to the Credit Facility.  Nothing  contained in this Section
shall be  construed  to release  the Issuer from the  performance  of any of the
agreements  on its part  herein  contained;  and if the  Issuer  should  fail to
perform any such  agreement,  the Lessee may institute  such action  against the

                                       12



<PAGE>

Issuer as the Lessee may deem  necessary to compel  performance  so long as such
action shall not impair the agreements on the part of the Lessee hereunder.

         Nothing  contained  herein shall be construed as a waiver of any rights
which the Lessee may have  against the Issuer under this  Agreement,  or against
any person  under this  Agreement,  the  Indenture  or  otherwise,  or under any
provision of law; provided,  however, that the Lessee shall pursue any rights or
remedies against the Issuer,  the Trustee,  any Bondholder or any third party in
connection herewith, or in connection with the Indenture,  the Lessee Documents,
the Credit  Issuer  Documents  or  otherwise  relating to the Bonds and security
therefor only in a separate action, and not by way of any set-off, counterclaim,
cross-claim  or third party  action in any suit brought to enforce the rights of
the bondholders,  the Trustee or the Issuer under this Agreement, the Indenture,
the Lessee  Documents,  the Credit  Issuer  Documents or otherwise in connection
herewith;  and  provided  further,  that in order to  preserve  the right of the
Lessee to raise such issues in any separate suit, any claim of the Lessee which,
but  for  this  Section  4.5,  would  be a  compulsory  counterclaim,  shall  be
identified as such in the first  responsive  pleading filed by the Lessee to any
action brought by the Issuer, Trustee, any Bondholder or any person.

         SECTION 4.6. LESSEE CONSENT TO ASSIGNMENT OF AGREEMENT AND EXECUTION OF
INDENTURE.  The Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Issuer will, pursuant to
the Indenture and as security for the payment of the principal of,  premium,  if
any, and the interest on the Bonds, assign and pledge to the Trustee, and create
a security interest in favor of the Trustee in certain of its rights,  title and
interest in and to this Agreement  (including all Pledged  Revenues)  reserving,
however,  the Reserved Rights; and the Lessee hereby agrees and consents to such
assignment and pledge.  The Lessee  acknowledges  that it has received a copy of
the Indenture and consents to the execution of the same by the Issuer; provided,
however, such consent does not constitute a representation as to the accuracy of
any representations or warranties made thereunder.

         SECTION 4.7. LESSEE'S  PERFORMANCE UNDER INDENTURE.  The Lessee agrees,
for the  benefit  of the  Bondholders,  to do and  perform  all acts and  things
contemplated in the Indenture to be done or performed by it.

         SECTION 4.8. INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION  METHOD. The Lessee,  with the
consent of the Credit Issuer, is hereby granted the right to designate from time
to time (i) changes in the Interest Rate Determination  Method in the manner and
to the extent set forth in Section 2.04 of the  Indenture and (ii) the length of
the  Medium-Term  Rate Period or the Maximum Term Rate,  as  applicable,  in the
manner and to the extent set forth in Section 2.03(e) of the Indenture.

         SECTION 4.9. PREPAYMENTS.  The Lessee may prepay all or any part of the
Lease Payments required to be paid by it under this Agreement,  at the times and
in the amounts  provided in Article VII for redemption of the Bonds,  and in the
case of  mandatory  redemptions  of the  Bonds,  the  Lessee  shall  cause to be
furnished  to the Issuer such amounts on or prior to the  applicable  redemption
dates. Prepayment of amounts due hereunder pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall be
deposited in the Bond Fund.

                              PARTICULAR AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 5.1.   MAINTENANCE,  OPERATION,  MODIFICATION  AND  INSURING OF
PROJECT; NO OPERATION OF PROJECT BY ISSUER.

         (a)  Throughout  the Lease Term,  the Lessee  shall at its own expense,
maintain  and operate all  portions of the Project  during their useful lives or
until they are  replaced  with  facilities  necessary in their  operation.  This
Agreement does not prevent the Lessee from merging or consolidating with another
entity as permitted by Section  5.3. The Lessee  further  agrees that it will at
its own expense keep the Project  properly  insured  against loss or damage from
such perils  usually  insured  against by  businesses  operating  or owning like
properties  and  maintain  public  liability  insurance  and all  such  worker's
compensation or other similar  insurance as may be required by law.  Evidence of
such  insurance  will be  furnished  to the  Issuer,  the Trustee and the Credit
Issuer upon  request.  Nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall be deemed to
authorize  or  require  the  Issuer to operate  the  Project  or to conduct  any
business enterprise in connection therewith.

         (b) The Lessee may from time to time, in its sole discretion and at its
own expense,  but subject to the  provisions of Section 5.9, make any additions,
modifications  or  improvements  to  the  Project,   including  installation  of
machinery,  equipment,  and  related  property,  which  it may  deem  desirable;
provided  that  all  such  additions,  modifications  and  improvements  do  not
adversely affect the structural integrity of the Building and are located wholly
within  the  boundary  lines  of the  Leased  Land.  With the  exception  of any
machinery,  equipment and related  property  which shall be  transferred  to the
Issuer  at the  option  of the  Lessee  pursuant  to  Section  5.9  hereof,  all
machinery,  equipment  and related  property  owned and  installed by the Lessee
which is not  financed  with Bond  proceeds,  shall be the sole  property of the
Lessee in which  neither the Issuer nor the Trustee  shall have any interest and
may be modified or removed at any time while the Lessee is not in default  under
this  Lease;  provided  that  any  damage  to the  Project  occasioned  by  such
modification  or removal  shall be  repaired  by the Lessee at its own  expense.
Furthermore,  all machinery,  equipment and related property owned and installed
by the  Sublessee  which is neither  owned by the Lessee nor financed  with Bond
proceeds,  shall be and remain the sole  property of Sublessee in which  neither
the  Issuer,  the  Trustee  nor the Lessee  shall have any  interest  and may be
modified or removed at any time while the  Sublessee is not in default under the
Sublease.

         SECTION   5.2.   ISSUER'S   AND   TRUSTEE'S   EXPENSES;   RELEASE   AND
INDEMNIFICATION  PROVISIONS.  The Lessee agrees, whether or not the transactions
contemplated by the Lessee Documents and the Indenture shall be consummated,  to
indemnify  and  hold  harmless  the  Issuer  and  its  officers,  commissioners,
directors,  officials,  employees and agents,  including the Trustee, counsel to
the Issuer and  financial  advisor to the Issuer  (any and all of the  foregoing
being hereinafter  referred to as the "Indemnified  Persons"),  from and against
any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings,  expenses,  judgments, damages,
penalties, fines, assessments,  liabilities,  charges or other costs (including,
without limitation, all attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with
enforcing  this Agreement or collecting any rents due hereunder and any claim or
proceeding or any investigation in connection  therewith) relating to, resulting
from or in  connection  with (i) any cause  whatsoever  in  connection  with the
Project, including,  without limitation, the acquisition,  design, construction,
installation,  equipping, operation, maintenance or use thereof or the financing
thereof  including  any  expenses  arising  from the failure to make  payment of
principal  and interest on the Bonds;  (ii) any act or omission of the Lessee or
any of its agents, contractors,  servants, employees or licensees, in connection
with  the  Project;  (iii)  the  issuance  and  sale of the  Bonds,  and  (iv) a
misrepresentation  or breach of warranty by the Lessee hereunder or under any of
the Lessee  Documents,  or any  violation by the Lessee of any of its  covenants
hereunder  or  under  any of the  other  Lessee  Documents.  This  indemnity  is
effective only with respect to any loss incurred by the Indemnified  Persons not
due to willful  misconduct,  gross negligence,  or bad faith on the part of such
Indemnified  Persons.  In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against
one or more of the Indemnified  Persons and in respect of which indemnity may be
sought as provided herein,  such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons shall
promptly  notify the Lessee in writing and the Lessee shall promptly  assume the
defense thereof,  including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons,  payment of all expenses and the
right to  negotiate  and  consent to  settlement;  but the failure to notify the
Lessee as provided  herein shall not relieve the Lessee from any liability  that
it may  have  (i)  under  this  Section,  so long as the  Lessee  is  given  the

                                       14


<PAGE>
reasonable  opportunity to defend such claim, and (ii) otherwise than under this
Section.  Any one or more of the  Indemnified  Persons  shall  have the right to
employ  separate  counsel in any such action and to  participate  in the defense
thereof,  but the  reasonable  fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense  of such  Indemnified  Persons  or  Indemnified  Persons  unless (x) the
employment  of such counsel has been  specifically  authorized in writing by the
Lessee,  (y) the named  parties  to any such  action  (including  any  impleaded
parties)  include  both the Lessee and such  Indemnified  Person or  Indemnified
Persons and  representation  of both the Lessee and such  Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential  differing  interests  between them, or (z) the Indemnified  Person or
Indemnified  Persons have been  advised  that one or more legal  defenses may be
available  to any or all of them  which may not be  available  to the  Lessee in
which case the Lessee  shall not be  entitled to assume the defense of such suit
notwithstanding  its  obligation  to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel.
The Lessee shall not be liable for any  settlement  of any such action  effected
without its  consent,  but if settled  with such  consent or if there is a final
judgment  in any such  action  with or without  consent,  the  Lessee  agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Persons from
and against any loss by reason of such  settlement  or judgment,  subject to the
limitations set forth above.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  this indemnity is
not intended and does not pertain to principal,  Purchase  Price and interest on
the Bonds.

         The provisions of this Section shall survive the Lease Term.

         SECTION  5.3.   MAINTENANCE  OF  EXISTENCE.   The  Lessee  agrees  that
throughout the Lease Term it shall maintain its existence as a limited liability
company  organized under the laws of the State of Georgia and shall not merge or
consolidate  with any  other  entity  and shall not  transfer  or convey  all or
substantially all of its property, assets and licenses;  provided,  however, the
Lessee may,  with the written  consent of the Issuer and without  violating  any
provision hereof,  consolidate with or merge into another domestic entity (I.E.,
an entity  existing  under the laws of one of the states of the United States of
America or the  District  of  Columbia)  or permit  one or more  other  domestic
entities to consolidate  with or merge into it, or transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to another domestic entity, but only on the condition that

         (a)   the  assignee  entity or the entity  resulting  from or surviving
               such  merger (if other than the Lessee) or  consolidation  or the
               entity  to which  such  transfer  is made  expressly  assumes  in
               writing  and agrees to perform  all of the  Lessee's  obligations
               hereunder  and under the Credit  Issuer  Documents  and the other
               Lessee Documents,

         (b)   in connection  with any such  consolidation,  merger or transfer,
               the Credit  Issuer  shall  expressly  ratify and affirm  that the
               Credit Facility remains in full force and effect, and

         (c)   the  surviving  entity shall  preserve and keep in full force and
               effect all licenses and permits  necessary to the proper  conduct
               of its business.

         SECTION 5.4. ANNUAL AUDIT. The Lessee agrees to cause the annual report
of the Credit Issuer (or its holding  company)  furnished to the stockholders of
the Credit  Issuer (or its holding  company) to be  furnished  to the Trustee as
soon as practicable after it is furnished to the Credit Issuer's (or its holding
company's)  shareholders  and upon request to furnish such annual  report to any
bondholder  who shall have filed his name and  address  with the Trustee for the
purpose of receiving  such annual  report and whose name and address  shall have
been transmitted to the Lessee by the Trustee.

         SECTION 5.5.  AGREEMENT  OF ISSUER NOT TO ASSIGN OR PLEDGE.  Except for
the Issuer's assignment and pledge of the Security, as defined in the Indenture,
and its  conveyance  of security  title to the Project  pursuant to the Security
Deed,  the Issuer  agrees  that it will not attempt to further  assign,  pledge,
transfer  or convey its  interest  in or create any  assignment,  pledge,  lien,
charge or  encumbrance  of any form or nature with respect to the Project or any
of the  property,  moneys,  securities  and rights  granted by the Issuer to the
Trustee under the Granting Clause of the Indenture.

         SECTION 5.6.  REDEMPTION  OF BONDS.  The Issuer or the Trustee,  at the
request  at any time of the Lessee  and if the same are then  redeemable,  shall
forthwith take all steps that may be necessary  under the applicable  redemption

                                       15


<PAGE>
provisions  of the  Indenture to effect  redemption of all or any portion of the
Bonds,  as may be specified by the Lessee,  on the earliest  redemption  date on
which such redemption may be made under such  applicable  provisions or upon the
date set for the  redemption  by the Lessee  pursuant to Article VII. As long as
the Lessee is not in default  hereunder  and the Issuer is not obligated to call
Bonds pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee
shall redeem any Bond prior to its stated maturity unless  requested to do so in
writing by the Lessee.

         SECTION 5.7.  REFERENCE  TO BONDS  INEFFECTIVE  AFTER BONDS PAID.  Upon
Payment in Full of the Bonds and of all fees and  charges of the Trustee and the
Remarketing  Agent, all references  herein to the Bonds and the Trustee shall be
ineffective  and neither  the Issuer,  the Trustee nor the holders of any of the
Bonds shall  thereafter have any rights  hereunder and,  subject to Article VIII
the Lessee  shall have no further  obligation  hereunder,  saving and  excepting
those that shall have theretofore vested and any right of any Indemnified Person
(as defined in Section 5.2) to  indemnification  under Section 5.2,  which right
shall survive the payment of the Bonds and the  termination  of this  Agreement.
Reference  is hereby  made to  Article V of the  Indenture  which sets forth the
conditions  upon the  existence or  occurrence  of which  Payment in Full of the
Bonds shall be deemed to have been made.

         SECTION  5.8.  ASSIGNMENT,  SALE OR LEASE OF  PROJECT.  The  Lessee may
assign or otherwise transfer its interest in this Agreement and may sublease the
Project  provided  that  (i) if the  Sublessee  is  other  than a  wholly  owned
subsidiary  of Abrams  Industries,  Inc.  or a  subsidiary  thereof  the written
consent of the Issuer is obtained,  (ii) the purchaser,  sublessee or transferee
in  such  transaction  shall  be  bound  by the  terms  and  provisions  of this
Agreement,  and (iii) such  transaction  shall not affect the  liability  of the
Credit Issuer under the Credit Facility.

         SECTION 5.9. REMOVAL OF LEASED EQUIPMENT. The Issuer shall not be under
any obligation to renew, repair or replace any inadequate,  obsolete,  worn out,
unsuitable,  undesirable,  inappropriate or unnecessary  Leased Equipment to the
extent any Leased  Equipment  exists at the  Project.  If the Lessee in its sole
discretion  determines  that any such  items of  Leased  Equipment  have  become
inadequate,  obsolete,  worn  out,  unsuitable,  undesirable,  inappropriate  or
unnecessary for its purposes at such time, the Lessee may remove such items from
the Building and the Leased Land and (on behalf of the Issuer) sell, trade-in or
otherwise dispose of them (as a whole or in part) without any  responsibility or
accountability to the Issuer or the Trustee  therefor,  provided that the Lessee
shall either:

         (a)   substitute  (either by direct  payment of the costs thereof or by
               advancing  to the  Issuer  the  moneys  necessary  therefor)  and
               install  anywhere  in the  Building  or on the Leased  Land other
               machinery,  equipment or related  property having similar utility
               (but not  necessarily  having the same  function or value) in the
               operation  of  the  Building  as  a  modern  industrial  facility
               (provided  such  removal  and   substitution   shall  not  impair
               operating unity), all of which substituted  machinery,  equipment
               or related  property shall be free of all liens and  encumbrances
               (other than Permitted  Exceptions) but shall become a part of the
               Leased Equipment; or

         (b)   not make any such  substitution  and  installation,  provided (i)
               that in the case of the sale of any such machinery,  equipment or
               related  property  to anyone  other than itself or in the case of
               the  scrapping  thereof,  the Lessee shall pay into the Bond Fund
               the proceeds  from such sale or the scrap value  thereof,  as the
               case  may be,  (ii)  that in the  case  of the  trade-in  of such
               machinery,  equipment or related  property  for other  machinery,
               equipment or related property not to be installed in the Building
               or on the Leased  Land,  the Lessee  shall pay into the Bond Fund
               the amount of the credit  received  by it in such  trade-in,  and
               (iii)  that  in the  case  of the  sale  of any  such  machinery,
               equipment or related property to the Lessee or in the case of any
               other  disposition  thereof,  the Lessee  shall pay into the Bond
               Fund  an  amount  equal  to  the   original   cost  thereof  less
               depreciation  at rates  calculated in accordance  with  generally
               accepted accounting principles.

The removal from the Project of any portion of the Leased Equipment  pursuant to
the provisions of this Section shall not entitle the Lessee to any diminution in
or  postponement  or abatement of the amount of the rents  payable under Section
4.2 hereof.

                                       16


<PAGE>
         The Lessee  shall  report to the Trustee and the Board of  Assessors of
the County each such removal, substitution,  sale, trade-in or other disposition
of Leased Equipment and shall pay to the Trustee such amounts as are required by
the  provisions of the preceding  subsection (b) of this Section to be paid into
the Bond Fund promptly after the sale,  trade-in or other disposition  requiring
such  payment;  provided,  however,  that no such payment or report need be made
until the  amount  with  respect  to items not  replaced  on account of all such
sales,  trade-ins or other  dispositions  and not previously  paid aggregates at
least $2,000,000.  The Lessee shall not remove or permit the removal of any item
of Leased Equipment except in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

         The  Lessee  shall  deliver  to  the  Issuer   appropriate   documents,
including,  but not limited to bills of sale,  conveying  to the Issuer title to
any machinery, equipment or related property installed or placed in the Building
or on the Leased Land pursuant to this Section,  and upon request of the Lessee,
the  Issuer  shall  deliver  and cause or direct  the  Trustee to deliver to the
Lessee  appropriate  documents  conveying  to the Lessee  title to any  property
removed  from the  Building  or the Leased  Land  pursuant  to this  Section and
releasing  the same from the lien of the  Indenture  and  canceling any security
interest with respect  thereto.  The Lessee shall take or cause to be taken such
action,  if any, as may be necessary to perfect a security interest with respect
to any property  placed in the  Building or on the Leased Land  pursuant to this
Section.

         SECTION 5.10. TAXES,  OTHER  GOVERNMENTAL  CHARGES AND UTILITY CHARGES.
The Issuer and the Lessee  acknowledge that under present law no part of the fee
simple  title in and to the  Project  owned by the Issuer  will be subject to ad
valorem  taxation  by the  State  of  Georgia  or by  any  political  or  taxing
subdivision  thereof, and that under present law the income and profits (if any)
of the Issuer  from the  Project  are not  subject to either  Federal or Georgia
taxation. The Lessee shall pay, as the same become lawfully due and payable, (i)
all taxes and  governmental  charges of any kind whatsoever upon or with respect
to the  interest  held by the  Lessee  under  this  Lease,  (ii) all  taxes  and
governmental  charges of any kind whatsoever upon or with respect to the Project
or any  machinery,  equipment  or related  property  installed or brought by the
Lessee  therein or thereon  (including,  without  limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any taxes levied upon or with respect to the income or profits of the
Issuer from the Project which,  if not paid,  will become a charge on the rents,
revenues  and  receipts  from the Project  prior to or on a parity with the lien
thereon and the pledge or assignment thereof created and made in the Indenture),
(iii) all utility and other charges incurred in the operation, maintenance, use,
occupancy  and  upkeep of the  Project,  and (iv) all  assessments  and  charges
lawfully  made by any  governmental  body for  public  improvements  that may be
secured  by a lien on the  Project;  provided,  that  with  respect  to  special
assessments  or  other  governmental  charges  that  may  lawfully  be  paid  in
installments  over a period of years,  the Lessee shall be obligated to pay only
such installments as are required to be paid during the Lease Term.

         The Lessee may, at its own expense and in its own name and behalf or in
the name and  behalf  of the  Issuer,  in good  faith  contest  any such  taxes,
assessments and other charges and, in the event of any such contest,  may permit
the taxes,  assessments  and other  charges so contested to remain unpaid during
the period of such  contest  and any appeal  therefrom  unless the  Issuer,  the
Credit  Issuer or the Trustee  shall notify the Lessee  that,  in the opinion of
Independent  Counsel,  by nonpayment of any such items the lien and/or  security
interest  afforded by the  Indenture as to any part of the Project or the rents,
revenues or receipts  derived from the Project will be materially  endangered or
the Project or any part thereof will be subject to loss or forfeiture,  in which
event such taxes,  assessments  or charges  shall be paid  promptly.  The Issuer
shall cooperate  fully with the Lessee in any such contest.  If the Lessee shall
fail to pay any of the  foregoing  items  required by this Section to be paid by
the Lessee,  the Issuer or the Trustee may (but shall be under no obligation to)
pay the same and any amounts so  advanced  therefor by the Issuer or the Trustee
shall  become an  additional  obligation  of the  Lessee to the one  making  the
advancement,  which amounts,  together with interest  thereon at the rate of ten
per centum (10%) per annum from the date thereof, the Lessee agrees to pay.

         SECTION 5.11.  COMPLIANCE WITH CREDIT  AGREEMENT AND SECURITY DEED. The
Lessee  hereby  covenants  and agrees that it will comply with all covenants and
obligations applicable to it in the Credit Agreement from time to time in effect
or, if the Credit  Agreement  is  terminated  prior to the  termination  of this
Agreement,  the  Lessee  agrees to comply  with all  covenants  and  obligations
applicable to it in the Credit Agreement as in effect  immediately  prior to the
termination  thereof until the  termination of this Agreement and the payment of

                                       17


<PAGE>
the Lessee's  obligation  hereunder.  Issuer and Lessee  covenant to comply with
their respective covenants and obligations in the Security Deed.

         SECTION 5.12.  INSPECTION OF PROJECT. The Issuer, the Trustee and their
duly  authorized  agents shall have the right at all  reasonable  times to enter
upon any part of the  premises of the Lessee at which the Project is located and
examine and inspect the same as may be  reasonably  necessary for the purpose of
determining  whether  the Lessee is in  compliance  with its  obligations  under
Section 5.1 or in the event of failure of the Lessee to perform its  obligations
under Section 5.1, and the Issuer,  the Trustee and their duly authorized agents
shall  also  have the right at all  reasonable  times to  examine  the books and
records  of  the  Lessee  insofar  as  such  books  and  records  relate  to the
acquisition, construction, installation and maintenance of the Project.

         SECTION 5.13.  PROJECT LIST.  The Lessee shall  maintain at the Project
site a list  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail  all items  constituting  the
Project.

         SECTION 5.14. NO WARRANTY OF CONDITION OR  SUITABILITY  BY ISSUER.  The
Lessee  recognizes that the Issuer does not deal in goods of the kind comprising
components  of the Project or otherwise  hold itself out as having  knowledge or
skill peculiar to the practices or goods  involved in the Project,  and that the
Issuer  is not one to whom such  knowledge  or skill  may be  attributed  by its
employment  of an agent or broker or other  intermediary  who by his  occupation
holds  himself  out as having  such  knowledge  or  skill.  The  Lessee  further
recognizes  that since the  components  of the  Project  have been and are to be
designated and selected by the Lessee,  THE ISSUER HAS NOT MADE AN INSPECTION OF
THE PROJECT OR OF ANY FIXTURE OR OTHER ITEM CONSTITUTING A PORTION THEREOF, AND,
EXCEPT  AS  OTHERWISE   PROVIDED  HEREIN,   THE  ISSUER  MAKES  NO  WARRANTY  OR
REPRESENTATION,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME OR TO
THE LOCATION, USE, DESCRIPTION, DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR USE FOR ANY
PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,  CONDITION  OR  DURABILITY  THEREOF,  TO THE QUALITY OF THE
MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP THEREIN, IT BEING AGREED THAT ALL RISKS INCIDENT THERETO
ARE TO BE BORNE BY THE LESSEE.  IN THE EVENT OF ANY DEFECT OR  DEFICIENCY OF ANY
NATURE IN THE  PROJECT  OR ANY  FIXTURE  OR OTHER  ITEM  CONSTITUTING  A PORTION
THEREOF,  WHETHER PATENT OR LATENT,  THE ISSUER SHALL HAVE NO  RESPONSIBILITY OR
LIABILITY  WITH  RESPECT  THERETO.  THE  PROVISIONS  OF THIS  SECTION  HAVE BEEN
NEGOTIATED  AND ARE  INTENDED  TO BE A COMPLETE  EXCLUSION  AND  NEGATION OF ANY
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS  BY THE ISSUER,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED  BY  APPLICABLE  LAW),  WITH  RESPECT TO THE PROJECT OR ANY FIXTURE OR
OTHER ITEM  CONSTITUTING  A PORTION  THEREOF,  WHETHER  ARISING  PURSUANT TO THE
U.C.C. OR ANOTHER LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT OR OTHERWISE.

         SECTION 5.15.   SPECIAL COVENANTS RELATED TO AD VALOREM TAXATION.

         (a) The Issuer and the Lessee  understand  that the Project  costs will
total at least  $11,000,000 and that the Project will consist of a manufacturing
facility.

         (b) The parties acknowledge that the Lessee's leasehold interest in the
Project is subject to taxation  pursuant to the  principles  enunciated by W. C.
Harris, et al. v. Douglas County Board of Tax Assessors, 240 Ga. 277; 282 S.E.2d
880 (1981) (the "Harris Case"). The parties further agree that,  pursuant to the
Harris Case,  the fair market value of the Lessee's  leasehold  interests in the
Project for real property and for  equipment  shall be determined by the formula
set forth in the Harris Case. The valuation of the Lessee's leasehold  interests
as  specified  in Exhibit A will be  returned  for ad valorem  taxation at forty
percent (40%) of the fair market value (the "assessed value") and the ad valorem
tax payable by the Lessee shall be the product of such assessed value multiplied
by the Douglas County millage rate for the applicable tax year.

         The  property  of  which  the  Project  is a part  will  be  valued  in
accordance  with the usual  procedures  and as if the Project  were not included
therein.
                                       18


<PAGE>
         (c) The Lessor and the Issuer  acknowledge that taxes payable by Lessee
on its leasehold interest takes into account the terms of this Agreement and the
fair market value of similar  leasehold  interests  in similar  property and the
prevailing rents charged in the geographic area of the Project.

         (d) At the  end of the  Lease  Term  with  respect  to the  Project  as
determined by application of paragraphs (b) and (c) and assuming that Payment in
Full of the Bonds has been made, the Issuer shall, for a consideration of $10.00
to be paid by the Lessee,  convey the Project to the Lessee and thereafter.  The
Lessee  shall own the Project and shall pay ad valorem  taxes in each year in an
amount required through the standard assessment procedures of the aforementioned
Board of Tax  Assessors,  said Project to be valued at its fee simple value upon
termination of this Agreement.

         (e) The Issuer agrees that if the Tax Commissioner  bills the Issuer it
will invoice the Lessee for the amount of ad valorem taxes  relating to Lessee's
interests  in the Project in the amounts  Lessee has agreed to pay, as described
above and the Lessee will pay such  amounts  directly to the Issuer as a portion
of its Additional Rent owing hereunder, for transmittal by the Issuer to the Tax
Commissioner  of Douglas  County,  as  required by law. In the event that in any
year the Board of Tax Assessors  values the Lessee's  leasehold  interest in the
Project in a manner which causes the taxes payable on such leasehold interest to
exceed the  amounts the parties  agree are payable by Lessee,  the Lessee  shall
have the right to appeal on behalf of the Issuer or in the Issuer's name,  place
and stead.

                         EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

         SECTION 6.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT DEFINED.  The following shall be "events
of default" hereunder and the term "event of default" shall mean, whenever it is
used herein, any one or more of the following events:

         (a)   failure by the Lessee to make any rental  payment  required to be
               made under Section 4.2(a) when the same becomes due and payable.

         (b)   failure  by the  Lessee  to  observe  or  perform  any  agreement
               hereunder or on its part to be observed or performed,  other than
               as referred to in subsection  (a) or (b) of this  Section,  for a
               period of thirty (30) days after written notice,  specifying such
               failure and requesting  that it be remedied,  given to the Lessee
               and to the Credit Issuer by the Issuer or the Trustee, unless the
               Issuer and the Trustee  shall agree in writing to an extension of
               such time  prior to its  expiration;  provided,  however,  if the
               failure  stated in the  notice  cannot be  corrected  within  the
               applicable   period,   the  Issuer  and  the  Trustee   will  not
               unreasonably  withhold their consent to an extension of such time
               if it is possible to correct such failure and  corrective  action
               is  instituted  by the  Lessee or the  Credit  Issuer  within the
               applicable  period and  diligently  pursued  until the failure is
               corrected;  or in the case of any such default which can be cured
               with due diligence  but not within such  thirty-day  period,  the
               Lessee's or Credit Issuer's  failure to proceed  promptly to cure
               such default and thereafter  prosecute the curing of such default
               with due diligence;

         (c)   any  representation  by or on behalf of the Lessee  contained  in
               this Agreement or in any instrument  furnished in compliance with
               or in reference to this  Agreement,  the  Indenture or the Credit
               Agreement  proves false or misleading in any material  respect as
               of the date of the making or furnishing thereof; and

         (d) an "event of default" occurs and is continuing under the Indenture.

         The Lessee and the Issuer hereby  authorize the Credit Issuer to do any
and all things necessary to correct any default described in paragraph (c) above
on behalf of the Lessee.

         The foregoing  provisions of subsection (c) of this Section are subject
to the  following  limitations:  If by reason of force  majeure,  the  Lessee is
unable  in whole  or in part to carry  out the  agreements  on its part  therein
referred to, the failure to perform such  agreements due to such inability shall
not  constitute an event of default nor shall it become an event of default upon
appropriate  notification  to the Issuer or the passage of the stated  period of
time. The term "force  majeure" as used herein shall mean,  without  limitation,
the following:  acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances;
acts of public  enemies;  orders  of any kind of the  government  of the  United
States  of  America  or of the  State  or any of  their  departments,  agencies,
political  subdivisions  or  officials,  or any  civil  or  military  authority;
insurrections;  riots; epidemics;  landslides;  lightning;  earthquakes;  fires;
hurricanes; tornadoes; storms; floods; washouts; droughts; arrests; restraint of
government and people; civil disturbances;  explosions;  breakage or accident to
machinery, transmission pipes or canals; partial or entire failure of utilities;
or any other cause or event not reasonably within the control of the Lessee. The
Lessee  agrees,  however,  to remedy with all  reasonable  dispatch the cause or
causes  preventing the Lessee from carrying out its agreements;  provided,  that
the settlement of strikes,  lockouts and other industrial  disturbances shall be
entirely  within the  discretion  of the  Lessee,  and the  Lessee  shall not be
required  to  make  settlement  of  strikes,   lockouts  and  other   industrial
disturbances  by acceding to the demands of the  opposing  party or parties when
such course is, in the judgment of the Lessee, unfavorable to the Lessee.

         SECTION 6.2. REMEDIES. Whenever an event of default shall have happened
and be continuing,  the Trustee, as the assignee and pledgee of the Issuer under
the Indenture, shall take any one or more of the following remedial steps:

                                       20


<PAGE>
         (a)   In the event the  Trustee  has  accelerated  payment of the Bonds
               pursuant to the  Indenture,  without  terminating  this Lease and
               without  retaking  possession of the Project,  the Trustee may at
               its option,  demand  immediate  payment of all Lease Payments due
               and payable  pursuant to Section 4.2 and all Additional  Rent due
               and payable pursuant to Section 4.4. The Lessee  acknowledges and
               agrees that upon any such  acceleration  of the Bonds,  the Lease
               Payments and the Additional Rent due and payable  pursuant hereto
               shall  consist  of (i)  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of the
               outstanding  Bonds,  (ii) all accrued and unpaid  interest on the
               Bonds to the date of payment of the principal of the  outstanding
               Bonds (but not any interest  that would have accrued on the Bonds
               for the  remainder  of the Lease  term if the Bonds had  remained
               outstanding)  and (iii) all other amounts then due and payable to
               the Issuer or the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4, including fees
               of  Counsel  actually  incurred.   The  Lessee  and  the  Trustee
               acknowledge and agree that the foregoing  payments  constitute an
               advance payment of rent, and not liquidated damages or a penalty,
               and that such payments  have been  discounted to present value by
               virtue  of the  exclusion  from the  calculation  thereof  of the
               rental payments for the remainder of the Lease term corresponding
               to the  interest  that  would  have  accrued on the Bonds for the
               remainder  of the Lease term if the Bonds  remained  outstanding.
               The Lessee shall receive as a credit  against such Lease Payments
               and  Additional  Rent  all  payments  made by the  Credit  Issuer
               pursuant to the Credit  Facility and all other amounts  described
               in Section  3.08(a) of the  Indenture.  The Trustee shall have no
               right to  exercise  the  remedy  provided  herein if the  Trustee
               terminates  this Lease or the Trustee  retakes  possession of the
               Project.  Upon payment of all such amounts, the Lessee shall have
               no further rental obligations under this Lease and the payment of
               such amounts  shall  constitute  Payment in Full of the Bonds for
               purposes of this Lease.

         (b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 6.5 hereof,  the Trustee may
               take whatever action at law or in equity may appear  necessary or
               desirable to collect any sums then due and  thereafter  to become
               due hereunder or to enforce performance and the observance of any
               agreement of the Lessee hereunder.

         (c) The Trustee may exercise any remedies provided under the Indenture.

Any amounts collected  pursuant to action taken under this Section shall be paid
into the  Bond  Fund and  applied  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the
Indenture  and after  Payment in Full of the Bonds and the  payment of any costs
occasioned by an event of default hereunder,  any excess moneys in the Bond Fund
shall be returned to the Lessee.

         The Lessee  hereby  authorizes  the  Trustee to draw  moneys  under the
Credit  Facility  in  accordance  with  the  Indenture  upon  a  declaration  of
acceleration  of  payment of the Bonds in an amount  equal to (i) the  aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Bonds and (ii) all interest on the Bonds due
and to become due to the date of payment.  The  obligation of the Lessee to make
accelerated  payment of all rental  payments  required  to be made by the Lessee
pursuant to Section 4.2 upon a  declaration  of  acceleration  of payment of the
Bonds shall be deemed  satisfied and discharged by a  corresponding  drawing and
payment under the Credit Facility.

         SECTION 6.3. NO REMEDY EXCLUSIVE.  Subject to the provisions of Section
6.5, no remedy herein  conferred  upon or reserved to the Trustee is intended to
be  exclusive  of any other  remedy,  but each and every  such  remedy  shall be
cumulative  and shall be in addition to every other  remedy  hereunder or now or
hereafter  existing  at law,  in equity or by  statute.  No delay or omission to
exercise any right or power accruing upon the occurrence of any event of default
shall  impair  any such  right or  power  or shall be  construed  to be a waiver
thereof,  but any such right or power may be exercised  from time to time and as
often as may be deemed  expedient.  The  Trustee  and the  holders of the Bonds,
subject to the provisions of the Indenture,  shall be entitled to the benefit of
all agreements herein contained.

         SECTION  6.4.  AGREEMENT  TO PAY COUNSEL  FEES AND  EXPENSES.  If there
should occur a default or an event of default  hereunder  and the Trustee or the
Issuer should employ  Counsel or incur other expenses for the collection of sums
due hereunder or the  enforcement  of performance or observance of any agreement
on the part of the Lessee  herein  contained,  the Lessee agrees that it will on
demand  therefor  pay to the  Trustee  or the  Issuer  the  reasonable  fees and

                                       21


<PAGE>
expenses of such Counsel actually incurred and billed and such other expenses so
incurred by the Trustee or the Issuer.

         If the  Lessee  should  fail  to make  any  payments  required  in this
Section,  such item shall continue as an obligation of the Lessee until the same
shall have been paid in full,  with interest  thereon from the date such payment
was due at the rate per annum borne by the Bonds until paid in full.

         SECTION   6.5.   WAIVER  OF  EVENTS  OF  DEFAULT  AND   RESCISSION   OF
ACCELERATION.  If, in compliance  with the  requirements  of Section 6.06 of the
Indenture,  the Trustee shall waive any event of default as therein defined with
the written  consent of the Credit  Issuer and its  consequences  or rescind any
declaration of  acceleration of payments of the principal of and interest on the
Bonds,  such  waiver  shall also waive any event of  default  hereunder  and its
consequences  and  such  rescission  of a  declaration  of  acceleration  of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds shall also rescind any declaration of any
acceleration  of all payments  required to be made under Section 4.2. In case of
any such waiver or rescission, or in case any proceeding taken by the Trustee on
account of any such event of default shall have been  discontinued  or abandoned
or determined adversely, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Lessee, the
Trustee,  the Credit  Issuer and the  holders of the Bonds  shall be restored to
their former  positions and rights  hereunder,  but no such waiver or rescission
shall  extend to any  subsequent  or other  event of default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

                                  PREPAYMENTS

         SECTION 7.1.   OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.

         (a) The Lessee shall have, and is hereby  granted,  with the consent of
the  Credit  Issuer,  if any,  the  option to prepay  Lease  Payments  in whole,
together  with interest  thereon to the date of redemption of the Bonds,  at any
time by taking,  or causing  the Issuer to take,  the  actions  required  by the
Indenture for the redemption of all Bonds then outstanding,  upon the occurrence
of any of the events set forth in Section 2.18(b) of the Indenture.

         (b) The Lessee shall have, and is hereby  granted,  with the consent of
the Credit Issuer,  if any, the option to prepay all or any portion of the Lease
Payments, together with interest thereon to the date of redemption of the Bonds,
at any time permitted by Section 2.18(a) of the Indenture by taking,  or causing
the Issuer to take,  the actions  required by the Indenture (i) to discharge the
lien thereof through the  redemption,  or provision for payment of redemption of
all Bonds then  outstanding or (ii) to effect the  redemption,  or provision for
payment or redemption, of less than all Bonds then outstanding.

         (c) To make a prepayment pursuant to this Section 7.1, the Lessee shall
give written  notice,  consented to by the Credit Issuer,  if any, to the Issuer
and the  Trustee  which  shall  specify  therein  (i) the  date of the  intended
prepayment,  which shall not be less than 45 days from the date any Bonds are to
be redeemed from such  prepayment,  and (ii) the principal  amount to be prepaid
and the date or dates on which the prepayment is to occur.  All such prepayments
shall be in the  amount  of the  unpaid  amount of the  Lease  Payments  if made
pursuant to Section  7.1(a) or in the amount of an  Authorized  Denomination  if
made pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and the Lessee shall furnish  additional  funds,
if necessary,  to make such prepayments in such amounts. In addition, the Lessee
shall make such  additional  Lease  Payments  as shall be  necessary  to pay any
redemption premium on the Bonds in connection with such redemption.

         SECTION 7.2.  OPTIONAL  PURCHASE OF BONDS.  Subject to the terms of the
Indenture  regarding the use of Eligible Funds,  the Lessee may at any time, and
from time to time,  furnish  moneys to the Tender Agent  accompanied by a notice
directing  such  moneys to be applied to the  purchase  of Bonds  delivered  for
purchase pursuant to terms thereof, which Bonds shall be delivered in accordance
with Section 2.08 of the Indenture.  The Lessee shall deliver to the Remarketing
Agent and the Credit Issuer a copy of any such notice.

         SECTION 7.3.  RELATIVE  PRIORITIES.  The  obligations  of the Lessee in
Section  7.2 of  this  Article  shall  be and  remain  superior  to the  rights,
obligations and options of the Lessee in Section 7.1 of this Article.

         SECTION 7.4.  PREPAYMENT TO INCLUDE FEES AND EXPENSES.  Any  prepayment
under this Article shall also include any expenses of prepayment, as well as all
expenses and costs provided for herein.

         SECTION 7.5.  OBLIGATIONS  AFTER PAYMENT AND  TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.
Anything  contained herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  the obligations of
the Lessee  contained in 5.2 and 6.4 shall continue after Payment in Full of the
Bonds and termination of this Agreement.

         SECTION 7.6.   PURCHASE OF BONDS.

         (a) In  consideration  of the issuance of the Bonds by the Issuer,  but
for the benefit of the Holders, the Lessee has agreed, and does hereby covenant,
to cause the necessary  arrangements  to be made and to be thereafter  continued
whereby the Holders from time to time may deliver, or may be required to deliver
Bonds for purchase and whereby such Bonds shall be so purchased.  In furtherance
of the  foregoing  covenant  of the Lessee,  the  Issuer,  at the request of the
Lessee, has set forth in the Indenture the terms and conditions  relating to the
delivery of Bonds by the  Holders  thereof  for  purchase,  has set forth in the
Indenture  the duties and  responsibilities  of the Tender Agent with respect to
the  purchase  of  Bonds,  and of the  Remarketing  Agent  with  respect  to the
remarketing of Bonds and has therein  provided for the appointment of the Tender
Agent and Remarketing Agent. The Lessee hereby authorizes and directs the Tender

                                       23


<PAGE>
Agent and the Remarketing  Agent to purchase,  offer,  sell and deliver Bonds in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

         Without  limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing  covenant  of the
Lessee,  and in  consideration of the Issuer's having set forth in the Bonds and
the Indenture the aforesaid provisions,  the Lessee,  covenants, for the benefit
of the Holders,  to provide for  arrangements  to pay, or cause to be paid, such
amounts as shall be  necessary  to effect the payment of the  Purchase  Price of
Bonds  delivered  for  purchase,  all  as  more  particularly  described  in the
Indenture.

         (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section,
the obligations of the Lessee under  subsection (a) of this Section with respect
to the purchase of Bonds shall be terminated on the date the Bonds begin to bear
interest at the Fixed Rate in accordance with the Indenture.

         (c) In  furtherance of the  obligations of the Lessee under  subsection
(a) of this Section, the Lessee shall provide for the payment of its obligations
under said  subsection  (a) by the  delivery  of the  Original  Credit  Facility
simultaneously  with the original  delivery of the Bonds.  In order to implement
such undertaking of the Lessee,  the Issuer, at the direction of the Lessee, has
set forth in the Indenture the terms and  conditions  relating to drawings under
the Credit  Facility to provide  moneys for the  purchase  of Bonds.  The Lessee
hereby  authorizes  and  directs  the  Trustee to draw  moneys  under the Credit
Facility  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the  Indenture  to the extent
necessary to provide  moneys  payable under Section 2.07 of the Indenture if and
when due.

         (d) The Issuer shall have no obligation or responsibility, financial or
otherwise,  with respect to the purchase of Bonds or the making or  continuation
of arrangements  therefor other than as expressly set forth in subsection (a) of
this Section  7.7,  except that the Issuer shall  generally  cooperate  with the
Lessee, the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent as contemplated in Section 2.07 of
the Indenture.

               interest of the  Indenture in the property  with respect to which
               such purchase is being consummated;

               Deed,  (iii) those liens,  security  interests  and  encumbrances
               resulting  from the  failure  of the Lessee to perform or observe
               any of the  agreements on its part  contained in this  Agreement,
               (iv) Permitted Liens other than the Indenture, and (v) the rights

of the Indenture.

instrument executed in connection herewith which shall entail the expenditure of

obligation payable solely from the Pledged Revenues.

         SECTION 10.8. IMMUNITY OF DIRECTORS,  OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF ISSUER.
No  recourse  shall be had for the  enforcement  of any  obligation,  promise or
agreement of the Issuer  contained in the  Indenture,  this  Agreement or in any
Bond issued  under the  Indenture  for any claim based  thereon or  otherwise in
respect thereof, against any director,  officer,  employee or agent, as such, in
his  individual  capacity,  past,  present  or  future,  of the Issuer or of any
successor  corporation,  either  directly or through the Issuer or any successor

corporation, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation,
under or by reason of any of the  obligations,  promises or  agreements  entered
into between the Issuer and the Lessee whether contained in this Agreement or to
be implied  therefrom  as being  supplemental  hereto or  thereto,  and that all
personal  liability of that  character  against  every such  director,  officer,

the  extent of any  payments  made by it  pursuant  to the Credit  Facility,  be
subrogated  to all  rights of the  Issuer  or its  assigns  (including,  without
limitation,  the  Trustee) as to all  obligations  of the Lessee with respect to
which such payments shall be made by the Credit  Issuer,  but, so long as any of
the Bonds remain  outstanding  under the terms of the  Indenture,  such right of
subrogation  on  the  part  of  the  Credit  Issuer  shall  be in  all  respects
subordinate  to all rights and claims of the Issuer for all  payments  which are
then due and  payable  under the  Indenture  or  otherwise  arising  under  this
Agreement,  the Indenture or the Bonds. The Trustee will, upon request,  execute
and deliver any instrument reasonably requested by the Credit Issuer to evidence
such subrogation and the Trustee shall assign to the Credit Issuer its rights in
any  obligations  of the  Lessee  with  respect  to which  payment of the entire
principal  balance  and  accrued  interest  thereon  shall be made by the Credit
Issuer.

otherwise  provided  herein  or in the  Indenture,  subsequent  to the  date  of
issuance  and  delivery  of the Bonds and prior to their  payment in full,  this
Agreement  may not be  effectively  amended or  terminated  without  the written
consent of the Issuer, the Lessee and the Credit Issuer.

         SECTION  10.11.  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement  may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

convenience only and in no way define,  limit or describe the scope or intent of
any provisions hereof.

         SECTION 10.13. AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement may be modified,
altered,  amended or  supplemented  in accordance with the Indenture in order to
obtain a rating of the Bonds by the Rating Agency.

         SECTION 10.14. LAW GOVERNING CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT.  This Agreement
shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the State.

         SECTION  10.15.   RELATIONSHIP  OF  PARTIES;  ESTATE  FOR  YEARS.  This
Agreement shall create the  relationship of lessor and lessee between Issuer and
Lessee and this  Agreement  grants to Lessee an estate for years in the  Project

         (a) The Company shall make each payment  hereunder not later than 12:00
noon on the day when due in lawful money of the United  States of America to the
Bank at its address  referred  to in Section  9.1.(c) in  immediately  available
funds.  The Company hereby  authorizes the Bank, if and to the extent payment is
not made when due  hereunder,  to charge  from time to time  against  any of the
Company's accounts with the Bank any amount so due. Computations of interest and
letter of credit commission  hereunder shall be made by the Bank on the basis of
a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may be,  for the  actual  number of days
(including  the first day but  excluding  the last day)  elapsed.  Whenever  any
payment to be made  hereunder  shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding  Business Day, and
such  extension  of time shall in such case be  included in the  computation  of
payment of interest or letter of credit  commission,  as the case may be. If any
amount  required to be paid by the Company to the Bank under this  Reimbursement
Agreement  or any  Related  Document  remains  unpaid  after such  amount is due
(whether  because of  operation  of law or  otherwise),  the  Company  shall pay
interest  on such past due amount from the date due until such amount is paid in
full at the Default Rate. All such interest shall be due and payable on demand.

         (b) On the first  Business  Day of each  month,  beginning  November 1,
1998,  the Company  shall  deliver  monies  equal to  one-twelfth  (1/12) of the
principal  amount coming due on the next November 1st, to the Bank. In addition,
not later than the  Business  Day prior to each  Interest  Payment Date and each
Redemption Date, the Company shall deliver monies sufficient to pay the interest
due and payable on such Interest  Payment Date or Redemption  Date. In any event
and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, not later than the Business
Day prior to each Interest  Payment Date and each  Redemption  Date, the Company
shall  deliver  monies  sufficient  to pay the  principal  and  interest due and
payable on such Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date.

         (c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall
receive  as a  credit  against  its  obligation  to make the  interest  payments
described  in  this  Section  2.4 all  payments  made by the  Trustee  from  the
Construction  Fund to reimburse the Bank for interest  drawings under the Letter
of Credit.

         (d) All monies  delivered to the Bank pursuant to Section  2.4(c) above
shall be deposited in the sinking  fund account  described in Section  3.2(a) of
this  Agreement,  and shall be used by the Bank to reimburse  the Bank for draws
under the Letter of Credit. While in such account, such monies shall be invested
in such  short-term  investments  as may be  directed  by the  Company  with the
consent of the Bank (but in any event so that the monies  will be  available  on
the payment dates for which reimbursement will be required), and all earnings on
such monies shall be deposited in the sinking fund account and used to reimburse
the Bank for draws under the Letter of Credit.

of contract or dispute between the Company,  the Trustee,  the Issuer, the Bank,

fraudulent,  invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement  therein or
made  in  connection  therewith  being  untrue  or  inaccurate  in  any  respect
whatsoever;  (f)  any  non-application  or  misapplication  by  the  Trustee  or
otherwise of the proceeds of any drawing under the Letter of Credit; (g) payment
by the Bank under the Letter of Credit in good faith against  presentation  of a
draft or certificate which does not strictly comply with the terms of the Letter
of  Credit;  and (h) any  other  act,  omission  to act,  delay or  circumstance
whatsoever  that might,  but for the  provisions of this  Section,  constitute a
legal  or  equitable  defense  to or  discharge  of  the  Company's  obligations
hereunder.  Nothing in this Section  shall  abrogate any right which the Company
may have to recover damages from the Bank under Section 2.6.

                      --------------------

         The  Company  agrees that  neither  the Bank nor any of its  directors,
officers,  employees or agents shall be liable or  responsible  for: (a) the use
which may be made of the  Letter of Credit or for any acts or  omissions  of the
Trustee or any other beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith;  (b) any
reference which may be made to this Reimbursement  Agreement or to the Letter of
Credit in any agreements,  instruments or other documents relating to the Bonds;
(c) the validity,  sufficiency or genuineness of documents other than the Letter
of Credit, or of any endorsement thereon,  even if such documents should in fact
prove to be in any or all respects invalid,  insufficient,  fraudulent or forged
or any  statement  therein  proves  to be untrue or  inaccurate  in any  respect
whatsoever;  (d) payment by the Bank against  presentation of documents which do
not  comply  with the terms of the Letter of  Credit,  including  failure of any
documents to bear any  reference or adequate  reference to the Letter of Credit;

under the  Letter of  Credit,  except  only that the Bank shall be liable to the
Company for acts or events  described  in clauses (a) through (e) above,  to the
extent,  but only to the  extent,  of any direct,  as opposed to  consequential,
damages  suffered by the Company which the Company proves were caused by (i) the
Bank's willful  misconduct or gross negligence in determining  whether a drawing
made under the Letter of Credit complies with the terms and conditions  therefor

                                       -13-

stated in the Letter of Credit or (ii) the Bank's  willful  failure to pay under
the Letter of Credit after presentation of a drawing by the beneficiary  thereof
strictly  complying with the terms and  conditions of the Letter of Credit.  The
Company  understands  and agrees that the Bank may accept a drawing that appears
on its face to be in order,  without  responsibility for further  investigation.
The  determination of whether a drawing has been made under the Letter of Credit
prior to its  expiration or whether a drawing made under the Letter of Credit is
in proper and sufficient form shall be made by the Bank in its sole  discretion,
which  determination  shall be  conclusive  and binding  upon the  Company.  The
Company  hereby  waives any right to object to any payment made under the Letter
of Credit with regard to a drawing that is in the form provided in the Letter of
Credit but which varies with respect to punctuation, capitalization, spelling or
similar matters of form.

         Section 2.7  Increased Costs.
                      ---------------

         If any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof
by any  court or  administrative  or  governmental  authority  charged  with the
administration  thereof or any  compliance by the Bank with any new guideline or
request  from any  central  bank or  administrative  or  governmental  authority

the Bank any other  condition  regarding  this  Reimbursement  Agreement  or the

clause (a) or (b) shall be to increase  the cost to the Bank or any  corporation
controlling  the Bank of issuing  or  maintaining  the  Letter of Credit  (which
increase in cost shall be determined by the Bank's reasonable  allocation of the
aggregate of such cost  increases  resulting  from any such event),  then,  upon
demand by the Bank, the Company shall  immediately pay to the Bank, from time to
time as specified by the Bank,  additional  amounts which shall be sufficient to
compensate the Bank or any  corporation  controlling the Bank for such increased
cost. A certificate  as to such  increased cost incurred by the Bank as a result
of any event mentioned in clause (a) or (b) above,  submitted by the Bank to the
Company,  shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for
all purposes.

BE FULLY EARNED AND NONREFUNDABLE  WHEN DUE. In no event shall the amount of any
interest  payable  hereunder  exceed the  maximum  rate of  interest  allowed by
Applicable  Law. It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Company
not pay and  the  Bank  not  receive,  directly  or  indirectly,  in any  manner

account  evidencing the indebtedness of the Company  resulting from each drawing

Reimbursement  Agreement,  the entries made in such record  shall be  conclusive
evidence, absent manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations

shall  not  excuse  the  Company  from  any  of  its   obligations   under  this
Reimbursement Agreement or any of the Related Documents.

         Section 2.11  Extension of Stated Expiration Date.
                       -----------------------------------

         The Company may request the Bank to extend the Stated  Expiration  Date
of the Letter of Credit for successive  five-year periods. On or before November
15,  2000,  the  Company  shall  request  such an  extension  by  executing  and
delivering  to the Bank a written  request  in the form of  Exhibit  C  attached
hereto (an "Extension")  executed by the Company. On or before November 15, 2005
and on or before  November 15, 2010,  provided the Bank has previously  extended
the stated  Expiration  Date,  the Company  shall  request an  extension in each
instance by executing and  delivering  to the Bank an Extension  executed by the
Company. Upon receipt of an Extension,  the Bank shall then determine whether or
not there is an Event of  Default  as  defined  herein or in any of the  Related
Documents.  If an Event of Default  exists under Section  8.1(a),  (f) or (g) of
this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  or a payment  default  exists under any Related
Document,  the Bank shall not be obligated to extend the Stated  Expiration Date
of the  Letter  of  Credit.  If any  other  Event of  Default  exists  under the
Reimbursement  Agreement or any Related Document, the Bank shall provide written
notice to the  Company  of such Event of Default  and the  Company  shall have a
period of thirty  (30) days after  receipt of said  notice to cure such Event of
Default.  If there is no Event of  Default  or if such Event of Default is cured
within such thirty (30) day period,  the Bank shall extend the Stated Expiration
Date by five (5) years by delivering to the Trustee,  on or before  December 31,
2000 and on or before December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2010, as applicable, an
Extension  Certificate in the form of Annex F to the Letter of Credit.  If there
is an Event of Default that is not cured as provided in this Section 2.11,  then
the Bank will not be obligated to extend the Letter of Credit and the Bank shall
not deliver an Extension  Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.11. Such
failure shall be deemed to be a denial of the Company's extension request.

         Section 2.12  Alternate Letter of Credit.
                       --------------------------

registered  in the Bank's  name or in the name of its  nominee,  pursuant to the

principal,  the Company shall pay interest on Demand,  at the default rate. (The

Collateral  Securities  shall be required by law, at least five  Business  Days'
notice to the Company of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute  reasonable  notification.

announcement  at the time and place fixed therefor,  and such sale may,  without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it will so adjourned.

the Company  shall have any right to withdraw  any of the funds held in the Cash
Collateral  Account,  except as otherwise  provided in subsection  (f) below and
except that upon the  termination of the Letter of Credit in accordance with its
terms and the indefeasible  payment and satisfaction in full of all Obligations,
any funds remaining in the Cash Collateral Account shall be returned by the Bank
to the Company or paid to whomever may be legally entitled thereto.

         (g)  So  long  as no  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing but subject to the  immediately  preceding  subsection  (b), the Bank
will  release  to the  Company  or at its order  (i)  interest  or other  income
received  on  Collateral  Securities  and  (ii) at the  written  request  of the
Company,  funds held in the Cash  Collateral  Account in an amount up to but not
exceeding  the  excess,  if any  (immediately  prior to the  release of any such
funds),  of (x) the total  amount of funds held in the Cash  Collateral  Account
over (y) the maximum amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit.

or  the  account  of the  Company  against  any  and  all  of  the  obligations,

statement or alleged  untrue  statement of any material  fact,  contained in the
Preliminary  Official  Statement or the Official  Statement or any  amendment or
supplement  thereto,  or by reason of the omission or alleged  omission to state
therein a material fact necessary to make such  statements,  in the light of the
circumstances  under which they were made, not  misleading;  provided,  however,
that,  in the case of any  action or  proceeding  alleging  an  inaccuracy  in a
material respect, or an untrue statement,  with respect to information  supplied
by and describing the Bank in the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official
Statement (the "Bank Information"),  (i) indemnification by the Company pursuant
to this Section  shall be limited to the costs and  expenses of the  Indemnified
Person  (including  fees and  expenses of Bank's  counsel) of  defending  itself
against such allegation,  (ii) if in any such action or proceeding it is finally

respect  or an untrue  statement,  then the  Company  shall not be  required  to
indemnify the Indemnified Person for any claims, damages,  losses,  liabilities,
costs or expenses to the extent caused by such  inaccuracy or untrue  statement,

Person without there being a final  determination to the effect described in the

         (b) by reason  of or in  connection  with the  execution,  delivery  or
performance of the Bonds,  the Indenture,  or the Agreement,  or any transaction

harmless an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section for any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities,  costs or expenses to the extent caused by such Indemnified
Person's  willful  misconduct  or gross  negligence.  Nothing in this Section is
intended to limit the Company's  obligations  contained in Section 2.2.  Without

any consent or approval required or permitted by this Reimbursement Agreement or
in any Related  Document  to be given by the Bank may be given,  and any term of
this Reimbursement  Agreement or of any Related Document may be amended, and the
performance  or  observance  by the  Company of any terms of this  Reimbursement
Agreement or such Related Document or the continuance of any Default or Event of
Default may be waived (either  generally or in a particular  instance and either
retroactively or prospectively)  with, but only with, the written consent of the
Company and the written consent of the Bank. No waiver shall extend to or affect
any obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent  thereon.  No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of the Bank in exercising any
right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be prejudicial  thereto. No
notice to or demand  upon the  Company  shall  entitle  the  Company to other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

         Section 9.7.  Survival.

prohibition  or  unenforceability  without  invalidating  the  remainder of such
provision  or the  remaining  provisions  hereof or  affecting  the  validity or

participations  in, or  otherwise  dispose of, all or any portion of its rights,
benefits and/or  obligations  under this  Reimbursement  Agreement and under any
Related  Document to any Person and in the event of any such  disposition by the
Bank,  all  references  herein to the Bank  shall be deemed a  reference  to the
Bank's transferee or participant to the extent of its participation. The Company

attorney-in-fact,  and to file, any financing or  continuation  statement or any
amendments  thereto with respect to any security pledged or assigned to the Bank
in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code or any applicable jurisdiction.

for other  property,  for  immediate or future  delivery,  and for such price or
prices and on such terms as the Bank in its discretion  shall deem  appropriate.
The Bank shall be  authorized at any sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to
restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and
agree  that they are  purchasing  the  Pledged  Bonds for their own  account  in
compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and upon consummation of
any such sale the Bank  shall have the right to assign,  transfer,  endorse  and
deliver to the purchaser or purchasers  thereof the Pledged Bonds so sold.  Each
purchaser  at any sale of Pledged  Bonds shall take and hold the  property  sold
absolutely  free  from any  claim or right on the part of the  Company,  and the
Company  hereby waives (to the fullest extent  permitted by Applicable  Law) all
rights of redemption,  stay and/or appraisal which the Company now has or may at
any time in the future have under any  Applicable  Law now existing or hereafter
enacted. The Company agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required
by Applicable Law, at least ten days' prior written notice to the Company of the
time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to
be made shall constitute reasonable notification,  but notice given in any other
reasonable  manner or at any other reasonable time shall  constitute  reasonable
notification.  At any such sale,  the Pledged  Bonds,  or portion  thereof to be
sold, may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels,  as the Bank
may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition to exercising the
power of sale herein  conferred  upon it, the Bank shall also have the option to
proceed by suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Pledge  Agreement
and sell the Pledged Bonds or any portion thereof pursuant to judgment or decree
of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction.

         Section 6.  Application  of  Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale of the
                     -------------------------
whole or any part of the  Pledged  Bonds shall be applied by the Bank in payment
of any of the  Obligations,  in any order which the Bank may elect.  The Company
shall remain liable and will pay, on demand, any deficiency remaining in respect
of the Obligations.

                      ----------------------------------
constitutes  and appoints the Bank as the  attorney-in-fact  of the Company with
full  power of  substitution  either  in the  Bank's  name or in the name of the
Company to do any of the following: (a) to perform any obligation of the Company
hereunder in the Company's name or otherwise;  (b) to ask for, demand,  sue for,

other instruments for the payment of money payable to the Company,  representing

any part thereof or on account  thereof and to give full discharge for the same;
(e) to exercise all rights,  powers and remedies  which the Company  would have,
but for this Pledge Agreement, under the Pledged Bonds; and (f) to carry out the
provisions  of this  Pledge  Agreement  and to take any action and  execute  any
instrument  which the Bank may deem  necessary or advisable  to  accomplish  the
purposes hereof,  and to do all acts and things and execute all documents in the
name of the Company or otherwise,  deemed by the Bank as  necessary,  proper and
convenient in connection with the preservation, perfection or enforcement of its
rights  hereunder.  Nothing herein  contained shall be construed as requiring or
obligating  the Bank to make any  commitment  or to make any  inquiry  as to the
nature or sufficiency  of any payment  received by it, or to present or file any
claim or notice,  or to take any action with respect to the Pledged Bonds or any
part  thereof  or the  moneys  due or to become  due in  respect  thereof or any
property covered thereby, and no action taken by the Bank or omitted to be taken
with  respect to the Pledged  Bonds or any part  thereof  shall give rise to any
defense,  counterclaim  or  offset  in favor of the  Company  or to any claim or
action against the Bank. The power of attorney granted herein is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest.

         Section 8. Further Assurances.  The Company shall, at its sole cost and
                    ------------------
expense,  take all  action  that may be  necessary  or  desirable  in the Bank's
opinion,  or that the Bank  may  request,  so as at all  times to  maintain  the
validity,  perfection,  enforceability  and  priority  of  the  Bank's  security
interest  in the  Pledged  Bonds (if any),  or to enable the Bank to exercise or
enforce  its rights  hereunder,  including  without  limitation,  executing  and
delivering financing statements, pledges, designations, notices and assignments,
in each case in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the Bank,  relating to the
creation,  validity,  perfection,  priority  or  continuation  of  the  security
interest granted  hereunder (if any). The Company agrees to take, and authorizes
the Bank to take on the Company's  behalf,  any or all of the following  actions
with respect to any Pledged Bonds as the Bank shall deem reasonably necessary to
perfect the security interest and pledge created hereby or to enable the Bank to
enforce its rights and  remedies  hereunder:  (a) to register in the name of the
Bank any Pledged Bonds in certificated or uncertificated form; (b) to endorse in
the name of the Bank any Pledged Bonds issued in  certificated  form; and (c) by
book  entry or  otherwise,  identify  as  belonging  to the Bank a  quantity  of
securities that  constitutes all or part of the Pledged Bonds  registered in the
name of the Bank.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Company agrees that Pledged

                                       5


<PAGE>
Bond which is not in certificated  form or is otherwise in book-entry form shall
be held for the account of the Bank. The Company  hereby  authorizes the Bank to
execute and file in all necessary and appropriate  jurisdictions  (as determined
by the Bank) one or more financing or continuation statements in the name of the
Company and to sign the Company's name thereto.  The Company authorizes the Bank
to file any  such  financing  statement,  document  or  instrument  without  the
signature of the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any property
comprising  part of the  Pledged  Bonds  required  to be  delivered  to the Bank
pursuant to this Pledge Agreement shall be accompanied by proper  instruments of
assignment  duly  executed  by the  Company  and by such  other  instruments  or
documents as the Bank or its counsel may request.

         Section 9.  Rights  Cumulative;  Non-Waiver  of Rights.  The rights and
                     -------------------------------------------
remedies  of the  Bank  under  this  Pledge  Agreement  are  cumulative  and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which it would  otherwise  have. No delay or
failure on the part of the Secured  Party in the exercise of any right or remedy
shall operate as a waiver thereof,  no single or partial exercise by the Secured
Party of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or
the  exercise of any other right or remedy and no course of dealing  between the
parties shall operate as a waiver of any right or remedy of the Secured Party.

         Section 10.  Indemnification.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold
                      ---------------
the Bank and any corporation controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with,  the Bank  and any  officer,  attorney,  director,  shareholder,  agent or
employee of the Bank or any such  corporation  (each an  "Indemnified  Person"),
harmless  from and against any claim,  loss,  damage,  action,  cause of action,
liability,   cost  and  expense  or  suit  of  any  kind  or  nature  whatsoever
(collectively,  "Losses"), brought against or incurred by an Indemnified Person,
in any manner arising out of or, directly or indirectly, related to or connected
with this Pledge Agreement,  including without  limitation,  the exercise by the
Bank of any of its rights and remedies under this Pledge  Agreement or any other
action  taken by the  Bank  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Pledge  Agreement;
provided,  however, the Company shall not be liable to an Indemnified Person for
any Losses to the extent that such Losses  result from the gross  negligence  or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified  Person. The Company's  obligations under
this section  shall  survive the  termination  of this Pledge  Agreement and the
payment in full of the Obligations.

         Section 11. Continuing  Security Interest.  This Pledge Agreement shall
                     -----------------------------
create a continuing  security  interest in the Pledged Bonds and shall remain in
full force and effect until indefeasible  payment and performance in full of the
Obligations.  The Company and the Bank hereby agree that the  security  interest
created by this Pledge  Agreement in the Pledged  Bonds shall not  terminate and
shall continue and remain in full force and effect  notwithstanding the transfer
to the  Company  or any  Person  designated  by it of all or any  portion of the
Pledged Bonds.

                              LETTER OF CREDIT AND
                             REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDMENT TO LETTER OF CREDIT AND  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT  (this
"Amendment")  is made and entered  into as of  September  1, 1998 by and between
ABRAMS RIVERSIDE, LLC (the "Company") and NATIONSBANK, N.A. (the "Bank").

                                   WITNESSETH:
                                   ----------

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to an  Indenture  of Trust,  dated as of November 1,
1997 (the  "Indenture"),  between the  Development  Authority of Douglas County,
Georgia (the "Issuer") and AmSouth Bank (the  "Trustee"),  the Issuer has issued
$11,000,000 in aggregate  principal  amount of the Issuer's  Taxable  Industrial
Development  Revenue Bonds  (Abrams  Riverside,  LLC Project),  Series 1997 (the
"Bonds") to provide funds to finance the acquisition, construction and equipping
of a  facility  for the  manufacturing  of store  fixtures,  located  in Douglas
County, Georgia (the "Project"); and

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to a Lease Agreement,  dated as of November 1, 1997,
between  the Issuer and the  Company,  the Issuer has leased the  Project to the
Company; and

         WHEREAS,  the Bank has issued to the  Trustee,  for the  account of the
Company,  an irrevocable direct pay letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") to
pay the principal and interest on the Bonds, as the same become due and payable;
and

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to a Letter of Credit and  Reimbursement  Agreement,
dated as of  November  1,  1997 (the  "Reimbursement  Agreement"),  between  the
Company and the Bank, the Company has agreed to pay to the Bank all amounts paid
under the Letter of Credit; and

         WHEREAS,  the Bank and the Company desire to amend a certain  provision
of the Reimbursement Agreement to clarify that the expiration date of the Letter
of Credit may be extended through the maturity date of the Bonds.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100
Dollars  ($10.00)  in hand  paid  this  day by the Bank to the  Company,  and in
consideration  of  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency  of which is hereby  acknowledged  by the Company and the Bank,  the
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:

         1.  AMENDMENT  OF SECTION  2.11.  Section  2.11 of the  Reimbursement
             --------------------------- Agreement  is  hereby    deleted   in
its entirety  and replaced by the following:



<PAGE>
                  "(a) The  Company  may  request  the Bank to extend the Stated
         Expiration Date of the Letter of Credit for successive  periods.  On or
         before  November 15, 2000,  the Company shall request such an extension
         by executing and  delivering to the Bank a written  request in the form
         of Exhibit C attached hereto (an "Extension  Request")  executed by the
         Company.  On or before  November  15, 2005,  on or before  November 15,
         2010,  and on or  before  November  15,  2015,  provided  the  Bank has
         previously  extended  the Stated  Expiration  Date,  the Company  shall
         request an extension in each  instance by executing  and  delivering to
         the Bank an Extension Request executed by the Company.

                  (b) Upon receipt of an Extension Request,  the Bank shall then
         determine whether or not there is an Event of Default as defined herein
         or in any of the Related Documents. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER
         SECTION  8.1(A),  (F) OR  (G) OF  THIS  REIMBURSEMENT  AGREEMENT,  OR A
         PAYMENT DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER ANY RELATED  DOCUMENT,  THE BANK SHALL NOT
         BE  OBLIGATED  TO EXTEND  THE STATED  EXPIRATION  DATE OF THE LETTER OF
         CREDIT.  If any other Event of Default  exists under the  Reimbursement
         Agreement  or any  Related  Document,  the Bank shall  provide  written
         notice to the Company of such Event of Default  and the  Company  shall
         have a period of thirty (30) days after  receipt of said notice to cure
         such Event of Default.  If any such Event of Default has not been cured
         as provided in this Section  2.11,  then the Bank will not be obligated
         to extend  the  Letter of  Credit,  and the Bank  shall not  deliver an
         Extension Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.11.

                  (c) If there is no Event of  Default or if an Event of Default
         (other than an Event of Default  under  Section  8.1(a),  (f) or (g) of
         this  Reimbursement  Agreement,  or a payment default under any Related
         Document) is cured  within such thirty (30) day period,  the Bank shall
         extend the Stated  Expiration  Date by five (5) years by  delivering to
         the Trustee,  on or before  December  31,  2000,  December 31, 2005 and
         December 31, 2010, as applicable,  an Extension Certificate in the form
         of Annex F to the Letter of Credit; provided,  however, with respect to
         the Extension  Request  delivered to the Bank on or before November 15,
         2015, the Bank shall extend the Stated Expiration Date by six (6) years
         to  November  15,  2018,  by  delivering  to the  Trustee  on or before
         December 31, 2015, an Extension  Certificate  in the form of Annex F to
         the Letter of Credit.  Any failure by the Bank to deliver an  Extension
         Certificate  to the Trustee by December 31, 2005,  December 31, 2010 or
         December  31,  2015  shall be deemed  to be a denial  of the  Company's
         extension request."

        2.  EFFECT. Except as expressly herein amended, the terms and conditions
            ------
of the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Loan Documents remain in full force
and effect.

<PAGE>
         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and

unconditionally,  guarantees the due and punctual  payment and performance  when

         SECTION 2.  GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND NOT OF COLLECTION. This Guaranty is
                     -----------------------------------------
a guaranty of payment,  and not of  collection,  and a debt of the Guarantor for
its own account. Accordingly, the Bank shall not be obligated or required before
enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantor: (a) to pursue any right or remedy

enforce  or  realize  upon any  collateral  security  held by the Bank which may
secure any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations.  In this  connection,  the Guarantor
hereby waives the right of the Guarantor to require any holder of the Guaranteed
Obligations  to take action  against the Lessee as provided in Official  Code of
Georgia Annotated Section 10-7-24.

Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
documents evidencing the same, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Bank with respect  thereto.  The liability of the Guarantor  under
this Guaranty shall be absolute and  unconditional  in accordance with its terms
and shall  remain in full force and effect  without  regard to, and shall not be

in the Reimbursement  Agreement) or any other document or instrument  evidencing
any  Guaranteed  Obligations,  or (iv)  any  renewal,  extension,  addition,  or
supplement  to, or deletion  from,  or any other action or inaction  under or in


                                    - 2 -


<PAGE>
respect of, the  Reimbursement  Agreement,  the Related  Documents  or any other
documents,  instruments or agreements relating to the Guaranteed  Obligations or
any other  instrument  or  agreement  referred  to  therein  or  evidencing  any
Guaranteed Obligations or any assignment or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (b)  any  lack  of  validity  or  enforceability  of the  Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents, or any other document, instrument or agreement
referred to therein or evidencing any  Guaranteed  Obligations or any assignment
or transfer of any of the foregoing;

         (c) any  furnishing  to the  Bank of any  additional  security  for the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any sale,  exchange,  release or  surrender  of, or
realization on, any collateral security for the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (d) any settlement or compromise of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations,
any security  therefor,  or any liability of any other party with respect to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  or any  subordination of the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations to the payment of any other liability of the Lessee;

         (e)   any   bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,    composition,
adjustment,  dissolution,  liquidation or other like proceeding  relating to the
Guarantor  or the Lessee or any other  Person (as  defined in the  Reimbursement
Agreement),  or any action taken with respect to this Guaranty by any trustee or
receiver, or by any court, in any such proceeding;

         (f)  any  nonperfection  of  any  security  interest  or  lien  on any
collateral securing any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

         (g) any application of sums paid by the Lessee or any other Person with
respect  to the  liabilities  of the  Lessee  to the  Bank,  regardless  of what
liabilities of the Lessee remain unpaid;

         (h) any defect, limitation or insufficiency in the borrowing power  of
the Lessee or in the exercise thereof;

         (i) any act or failure to act by the Bank  which may  adversely  affect
the  Guarantor's  subrogation  rights,  if any,  against  the  Lessee to recover
payments made under this Guaranty;

         (j) any other circumstance  which might otherwise  constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, the Guarantor.

         SECTION 4. ACTION WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. The Bank may,
                    ---------------------------------------------
at any time and from time to time,  without  the  consent  of, or notice to, the



                                    - 3 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor,  and without discharging the Guarantor from its obligations hereunder
take any and all actions  described  in Section 3 above and may  otherwise:  (a)
amend,  modify,  alter  or  supplement  the  terms  of  any  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  including, but not limited to, extending or shortening the time of
payment  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  increasing,  decreasing  or
otherwise  changing  the  interest  rate or fees  that may  accrue on any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) amend, modify, alter or supplement the Reimbursement
Agreement, the Related Documents or any other document evidencing any Guaranteed
Obligations;  (c) sell,  exchange,  release or  otherwise  deal with all, or any
part,  of any  Collateral;  (d) release any Person  liable in any manner for the
payment or collection of the Guaranteed  Obligations;  (e) exercise,  or refrain
from exercising,  any rights against the Lessee or any other Person  (including,
without limitation, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations);  and (f)
apply  any sum,  by  whomsoever  paid or  however  realized,  to the  Guaranteed
Obligations in such order as the Bank shall elect.

         SECTION 5.  WAIVER.  The Guarantor,  to the fullest extent permitted by
                     ------
law,  hereby  waives  notice of acceptance  hereof or any  presentment,  demand,
protest or notice of any kind, and any other act or thing,  or omission or delay
to do any other act or thing,  which in any manner or to any  extent  might vary
the risk of the  Guarantor or which  otherwise  might  operate to discharge  the
Guarantor from its obligations hereunder;  provided, however, that the Guarantor
shall be provided with copies of all notices delivered to the Lessee pursuant to
Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         SECTION 6.  INABILITY TO ACCELERATE  LOAN. If the Bank or the holder of
                     -----------------------------
any of the Guaranteed Obligations is prevented under Applicable Law or otherwise
from demanding or  accelerating  payment thereof by reason of any automatic stay
or  otherwise,  the Bank or such holder  shall be  entitled to receive  from the
Guarantor,  upon demand  therefor,  the sums which otherwise would have been due
had such demand or acceleration occurred.

         SECTION 7.  REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS.  If claim is ever
                     ----------------------------------------
made upon the Bank for  repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts  received
in  payment or on account  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and the Bank
repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative  body having jurisdiction over the Bank or any of
its property,  or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by
the Bank with any such claimant (including the Lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy
for the Lessee),  then,  and in such event,  the Guarantor  agrees that any such
judgment,  decree,  order,  settlement  or  compromise  shall be  binding on it,
notwithstanding  any revocation  hereof or the cancellation of the Reimbursement
Agreement,  the other Related Documents,  or any other instrument evidencing any
liability of the Lessee,  and the  Guarantor  shall be and remain  liable to the
Bank for the amounts so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount
had never originally been paid to the Bank.

         SECTION 8.  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  The Guarantor hereby forever waives
                     ---------------------
and  releases  any and all  claims or causes of action  the  Guarantor  may have
against the Lessee or any other  Person  arising by reason of any payment by the


                                    - 4 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor to the Bank pursuant to this Guaranty,  whether such claim or cause of
action arises by way of any common-law right of subrogation, by way of any other
applicable law or statutes,  or by way of any written or oral agreement  between
the Guarantor and the Lessee or any other Person.  This waiver of subrogation is
for the benefit of the Lessee and the Bank and the  foregoing  waiver may not be
revoked by the Guarantor without the prior, written consent of Bank.

         SECTION 9.  PAYMENTS  FREE AND CLEAR. All sums payable by the Guarantor
                     ------------------------
hereunder,   whether  of  principal,   interest,  fees,  expenses,  premiums  or
otherwise,  shall  be paid in  full,  without  set-off  or  counterclaim  or any
deduction or withholding  whatsoever (including any withholding tax or liability
imposed  by any  governmental  agency or  authority,  wherever  located,  or any
statute,  rule or  regulation  promulgated  thereby),  and in the event that the
Guarantor is required by such applicable law or by such  governmental  agency or
authority to make any such deduction or withholding,  the Guarantor shall pay to
the Bank such additional amount as will result in the receipt by the Bank of the
full amount payable  hereunder had such deduction or withholding not occurred or
been required.

         SECTION 10.  SET-OFF. The Guarantor authorizes the Bank at any time and
                      -------
from time to time,  without notice to the Guarantor,  which notice the Guarantor
hereby  expressly  waives,  to set off and apply any and all  deposits  (whether

negotiable or  non-negotiable  certificate of deposit now or hereafter issued by
the  Bank to the  Guarantor)  or  other  indebtedness  owing  by the Bank to the
Guarantor,  to the then outstanding Guaranteed Obligations then due and payable.
The Bank may  exercise  this  right of setoff  whether  or not the Bank has made
demand for, or accelerated,  any Guaranteed Obligations.  The rights of the Bank
under this Section are in addition to, and not in limitation or substitution of,
other  rights and  remedies  (including,  but not  limited to,  other  rights of

GUARANTORS. As an independent covenant, the Guarantor hereby expressly covenants
- ----------
and agrees  for the  benefit of the Bank that all  obligations  and  liabilities
owing  by  the  Lessee  to the  Guarantor,  if  any  of  whatsoever  description
including,  without  limitation,  all  intercompany  receivables  owing  to  the
Guarantor from the Lessee  ("Junior  Claims") shall be subordinate and junior in
right of payment to all obligations of the Lessee to the Bank under the terms of
the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Related Documents ("Senior Claims").

         If an Event of Default shall occur,  then,  unless and until such Event
of Default  shall have been cured,  waived,  or shall have  ceased to exist,  no
direct  or  indirect  payment  (in  cash,  property,  securities  by  setoff  or
otherwise)  shall be made by the Lessee to the Guarantor on account of or in any
manner in respect of any Junior  Claim and the  Guarantor  shall not  receive or
accept any such direct or indirect payment.

<PAGE>
         In the event of a  Proceeding  (as  hereinafter  defined),  all  Senior
Claims  shall  first be paid in full  before any direct or  indirect  payment or
distribution  (in cash,  property,  securities by setoff or otherwise)  shall be
made to any  Guarantor  on  account of or in any manner in respect of any Junior
Claim. For the purposes of the previous sentence,  "Proceeding" means the Lessee
or the Guarantor  shall  commence a voluntary case  concerning  itself under the
Bankruptcy  Code of 1978,  as  amended  (the  "Bankruptcy  Code")  or any  other
applicable  bankruptcy  laws; or any involuntary  case is commenced  against the
Lessee or the Guarantor;  or a custodian (as defined in the  Bankruptcy  Code or
any other applicable  bankruptcy laws) is appointed for, or takes charge of, all
or any substantial  part of the property of the Lessee or the Guarantor,  or the
Lessee or the Guarantor commences any other proceedings under any reorganization
arrangement,  adjustment of debt, relief of debtor,  dissolution,  insolvency or
liquidation  or similar  law of any  jurisdiction  whether now or  hereafter  in
effect  relating  to the  Lessee or the  Guarantor,  or any such  proceeding  is
commenced against the Lessee or the Guarantor, or the Lessee or the Guarantor is
adjudicated  insolvent  or  bankrupt;  or any  order of  relief  or other  order
approving any such case or proceeding is entered; or the Lessee or the Guarantor
suffers any  appointment of any custodian or the like for it or any  substantial
part of its property;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor shall fail to pay,
or shall  state that it is unable to pay,  or shall be unable to pay,  its debts
generally  as they  become  due;  or the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall call a
meeting of its creditors with a view to arranging a composition or adjustment of
its  debts;  or the Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall by any act or failure to act
indicate its consent to, approval of or acquiescence in any of the foregoing; or
any  corporate  action  shall be taken by the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  for the
purpose of effecting any of the foregoing.

         In the event any direct or indirect  payment or distribution is made to
the Guarantor in  contravention of this Section 11, such payment or distribution
shall be  deemed  received  in trust  for the  benefit  of the Bank and shall be
immediately  paid  over to the  Bank  for  application  against  the  Guaranteed
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         The Guarantor  agrees to execute such additional  documents as the Bank
may  reasonably  request to  evidence  the  subordination  provided  for in this
Section 11.

         SECTION  12.  AUTOMATIC   ACCELERATION  IN  CERTAIN  EVENTS.  Upon  the
                       ---------------------------------------------
occurrence of an Event of Default  specified in Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement
Agreement, all Guaranteed Obligations shall automatically become immediately due
and payable by the Guarantor,  without notice or other action on the part of the
Bank,  and regardless of whether  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations by the
Lessee has then been accelerated.  In addition,  if any of the Events of Default
described in Sections 8.1(f) and (g) of the Reimbursement Agreement should occur
with  respect  to  the  Guarantor,   then  the  Guaranteed   Obligations   shall
automatically  become  immediately  due and  payable by the  Guarantor,  without

the Guarantor  assumes and incurs  hereunder,  and agrees that the Bank will not
have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information  known to it or any of them
regarding such circumstances or risks.

agrees as follows:

         SECTION  1.   GUARANTY.   The   Guarantor   hereby,   irrevocably   and
                       --------

hereby waives the right of the Guarantor to require any holder of the Guaranteed
Obligations  to take action  against the Lessee as provided in Official  Code of
Georgia Annotated Section 10-7-24.

Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
documents evidencing the same, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or
hereafter  in  effect in any  jurisdiction  affecting  any of such  terms or the
rights of the Bank with respect  thereto.  The liability of the Guarantor  under
this Guaranty shall be absolute and  unconditional  in accordance with its terms
and shall  remain in full force and effect  without  regard to, and shall not be

manner of payment of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations,  or (iii)
any amendment or waiver of, or consent to the departure from or other indulgence
with respect to, the Reimbursement  Agreement, the Related Documents (as defined
in the Reimbursement  Agreement) or any other document or instrument  evidencing

<PAGE>
Guarantor,  and without discharging the Guarantor from its obligations hereunder
take any and all actions  described  in Section 3 above and may  otherwise:  (a)
amend,  modify,  alter  or  supplement  the  terms  of  any  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  including, but not limited to, extending or shortening the time of
payment  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or  increasing,  decreasing  or
otherwise  changing  the  interest  rate or fees  that may  accrue on any of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) amend, modify, alter or supplement the Reimbursement

apply  any sum,  by  whomsoever  paid or  however  realized,  to the  Guaranteed
Obligations in such order as the Bank shall elect.

         SECTION 5.  WAIVER.  The Guarantor,  to the fullest extent permitted by
                     ------
law,  hereby  waives  notice of acceptance  hereof or any  presentment,  demand,
protest or notice of any kind, and any other act or thing,  or omission or delay
to do any other act or thing,  which in any manner or to any  extent  might vary
the risk of the  Guarantor or which  otherwise  might  operate to discharge  the
Guarantor from its obligations hereunder;  provided, however, that the Guarantor
shall be provided with copies of all notices delivered to the Lessee pursuant to
Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         SECTION 6.  INABILITY TO ACCELERATE  LOAN. If the Bank or the holder of
                     -----------------------------
any of the Guaranteed Obligations is prevented under Applicable Law or otherwise
from demanding or  accelerating  payment thereof by reason of any automatic stay
or  otherwise,  the Bank or such holder  shall be  entitled to receive  from the
Guarantor,  upon demand  therefor,  the sums which otherwise would have been due
had such demand or acceleration occurred.

         SECTION 7.  REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTEED  OBLIGATIONS.  If claim is ever
                     ----------------------------------------
made upon the Bank for  repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts  received
in  payment or on account  of any of the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  and the Bank
repays all or part of said amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative  body having jurisdiction over the Bank or any of
its property,  or (b) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by
the Bank with any such claimant (including the Lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy
for the Lessee),  then,  and in such event,  the Guarantor  agrees that any such
judgment,  decree,  order,  settlement  or  compromise  shall be  binding on it,
notwithstanding  any revocation  hereof or the cancellation of the Reimbursement
Agreement,  the other Related Documents,  or any other instrument evidencing any
liability of the Lessee,  and the  Guarantor  shall be and remain  liable to the
Bank for the amounts so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount
had never originally been paid to the Bank.

         SECTION 8.  WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  The Guarantor hereby forever waives
                     ---------------------
and  releases  any and all  claims or causes of action  the  Guarantor  may have
against the Lessee or any other  Person  arising by reason of any payment by the


                                    - 4 -


<PAGE>
Guarantor to the Bank pursuant to this Guaranty,  whether such claim or cause of
action arises by way of any common-law right of subrogation, by way of any other
applicable law or statutes,  or by way of any written or oral agreement  between
the Guarantor and the Lessee or any other Person.  This waiver of subrogation is
for the benefit of the Lessee and the Bank and the  foregoing  waiver may not be
revoked by the Guarantor without the prior, written consent of Bank.

         SECTION 9.  PAYMENTS  FREE AND CLEAR. All sums payable by the Guarantor
                     ------------------------
hereunder,   whether  of  principal,   interest,  fees,  expenses,  premiums  or
otherwise,  shall  be paid in  full,  without  set-off  or  counterclaim  or any
deduction or withholding  whatsoever (including any withholding tax or liability
imposed  by any  governmental  agency or  authority,  wherever  located,  or any
statute,  rule or  regulation  promulgated  thereby),  and in the event that the
Guarantor is required by such applicable law or by such  governmental  agency or
authority to make any such deduction or withholding,  the Guarantor shall pay to
the Bank such additional amount as will result in the receipt by the Bank of the
full amount payable  hereunder had such deduction or withholding not occurred or
been required.

         SECTION 10.  SET-OFF. The Guarantor authorizes the Bank at any time and
                      -------
from time to time,  without notice to the Guarantor,  which notice the Guarantor
hereby  expressly  waives,  to set off and apply any and all  deposits  (whether
general  or  special,  time or  demand,  provisional  or  final,  including  any
negotiable or  non-negotiable  certificate of deposit now or hereafter issued by
the  Bank to the  Guarantor)  or  other  indebtedness  owing  by the Bank to the
Guarantor,  to the then outstanding Guaranteed Obligations then due and payable.
The Bank may  exercise  this  right of setoff  whether  or not the Bank has made
demand for, or accelerated,  any Guaranteed Obligations.  The rights of the Bank
under this Section are in addition to, and not in limitation or substitution of,
other  rights and  remedies  (including,  but not  limited to,  other  rights of
set-off) that the Bank may have.

         SECTION  11.   SUBORDINATION   OF  THE  LESSEE'S   OBLIGATIONS  TO  THE
                        --------------------------------------------------------
GUARANTORS. As an independent covenant, the Guarantor hereby expressly covenants
- ----------
and agrees  for the  benefit of the Bank that all  obligations  and  liabilities
owing  by  the  Lessee  to the  Guarantor,  if  any  of  whatsoever  description
including,  without  limitation,  all  intercompany  receivables  owing  to  the
Guarantor from the Lessee  ("Junior  Claims") shall be subordinate and junior in
right of payment to all obligations of the Lessee to the Bank under the terms of
the Reimbursement Agreement and the other Related Documents ("Senior Claims").

         If an Event of Default shall occur,  then,  unless and until such Event
of Default  shall have been cured,  waived,  or shall have  ceased to exist,  no
direct  or  indirect  payment  (in  cash,  property,  securities  by  setoff  or
otherwise)  shall be made by the Lessee to the Guarantor on account of or in any
manner in respect of any Junior  Claim and the  Guarantor  shall not  receive or
accept any such direct or indirect payment.


                                    - 5 -


<PAGE>
         In the event of a  Proceeding  (as  hereinafter  defined),  all  Senior
Claims  shall  first be paid in full  before any direct or  indirect  payment or
distribution  (in cash,  property,  securities by setoff or otherwise)  shall be
made to any  Guarantor  on  account of or in any manner in respect of any Junior
Claim. For the purposes of the previous sentence,  "Proceeding" means the Lessee
or the Guarantor  shall  commence a voluntary case  concerning  itself under the
Bankruptcy  Code of 1978,  as  amended  (the  "Bankruptcy  Code")  or any  other
applicable  bankruptcy  laws; or any involuntary  case is commenced  against the
Lessee or the Guarantor;  or a custodian (as defined in the  Bankruptcy  Code or
any other applicable  bankruptcy laws) is appointed for, or takes charge of, all
or any substantial  part of the property of the Lessee or the Guarantor,  or the
Lessee or the Guarantor commences any other proceedings under any reorganization
arrangement,  adjustment of debt, relief of debtor,  dissolution,  insolvency or
liquidation  or similar  law of any  jurisdiction  whether now or  hereafter  in
effect  relating  to the  Lessee or the  Guarantor,  or any such  proceeding  is
commenced against the Lessee or the Guarantor, or the Lessee or the Guarantor is
adjudicated  insolvent  or  bankrupt;  or any  order of  relief  or other  order
approving any such case or proceeding is entered; or the Lessee or the Guarantor
suffers any  appointment of any custodian or the like for it or any  substantial
part of its property;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors;  or the Lessee or the Guarantor shall fail to pay,
or shall  state that it is unable to pay,  or shall be unable to pay,  its debts
generally  as they  become  due;  or the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall call a
meeting of its creditors with a view to arranging a composition or adjustment of
its  debts;  or the Lessee or the  Guarantor  shall by any act or failure to act
indicate its consent to, approval of or acquiescence in any of the foregoing; or
any  corporate  action  shall be taken by the  Lessee or the  Guarantor  for the
purpose of effecting any of the foregoing.

         In the event any direct or indirect  payment or distribution is made to
the Guarantor in  contravention of this Section 11, such payment or distribution
shall be  deemed  received  in trust  for the  benefit  of the Bank and shall be
immediately  paid  over to the  Bank  for  application  against  the  Guaranteed
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

         The Guarantor  agrees to execute such additional  documents as the Bank
may  reasonably  request to  evidence  the  subordination  provided  for in this
Section 11.

         SECTION  12.  AUTOMATIC   ACCELERATION  IN  CERTAIN  EVENTS.  Upon  the
                       ---------------------------------------------
occurrence of an Event of Default  specified in Section 8.1 of the Reimbursement
Agreement, all Guaranteed Obligations shall automatically become immediately due
and payable by the Guarantor,  without notice or other action on the part of the
Bank,  and regardless of whether  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations by the
Lessee has then been accelerated.  In addition,  if any of the Events of Default
described in Sections 8.1(f) and (g) of the Reimbursement Agreement should occur
with  respect  to  the  Guarantor,   then  the  Guaranteed   Obligations   shall
automatically  become  immediately  due and  payable by the  Guarantor,  without


                                    - 6 -

notice or other  action  on the part of the  Bank,  and  regardless  of  whether
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations by the Lessee has then been accelerated.

         SECTION 13.  INFORMATION.  The Guarantor assumes all responsibility for
                      -----------
being and  keeping  itself  informed of the  Lessee's  financial  condition  and
assets,  and of all other  circumstances  bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Guaranteed  Obligations  and the nature,  scope and extent of the risks that
the Guarantor  assumes and incurs  hereunder,  and agrees that the Bank will not
have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information  known to it or any of them
regarding such circumstances or risks.

          SECTION 14.  GOVERNING  LAW. This  Guaranty  shall be governed by, and
                       --------------
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of GEORGIA.

THE NORTHERN  DISTRICT OF GEORGIA OR ANY STATE COURT  LOCATED IN DOUGLAS  COUNTY
SHALL HAVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN THE
GUARANTOR AND THE BANK PERTAINING  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THIS GUARANTY OR TO
ANY MATTER ARISING  HEREFROM.  THE GUARANTOR  EXPRESSLY  SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN
ADVANCE TO SUCH  JURISDICTION  IN ANY  ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  COMMENCED  IN SUCH
COURT.  THE  GUARANTOR  AND THE  BANK  WAIVE  ANY  OBJECTION  THAT IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER  HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY  PROCEEDING  IN ANY SUCH  COURT OR THAT SUCH
PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT  FORUM AND EACH AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM THE SAME.

STATES MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID ADDRESSED TO THE GUARANTOR AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH
BELOW ITS SIGNATURE  HERETO.  SHOULD THE GUARANTOR  FAIL TO APPEAR OR ANSWER ANY
SUMMONS,  COMPLAINT,  PROCESS OR PAPERS SO SERVED  WITHIN  THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE
MAILING  THEREOF,  IT SHALL BE DEEMED IN DEFAULT AN ORDER AND/OR JUDGMENT MAY BE
ENTERED AGAINST IT AS PRAYED FOR IN SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS.

         (d) THE CHOICE OF FORUM SET FORTH IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL NOT BE DEEMED
TO PRECLUDE  THE  BRINGING OF ANY ACTION BY THE BANK OR THE  ENFORCEMENT  BY THE

COUNTERCLAIM OR CROSS-CLAIM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

         (f) THE GUARANTOR  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL OF THE WAIVERS IN THIS SECTION

binding  upon the  Guarantor  as to the  outstanding  amount of such  Guaranteed
Obligations  and the  amounts  paid and  payable  with  respect  thereto  absent
manifest  error.  The  failure of the Bank to maintain  such books and  accounts
shall  not  in  any  way  relieve  or  discharge  the  Guarantor  of  any of its
obligations hereunder.

         SECTION 17.  WAIVER OF REMEDIES. No delay or failure on the part of the
                      ------------------
Bank in the  exercise of any right or remedy it may have  against the  Guarantor

Dear Shareholders:

         Abrams Industries' 74th year was a period of transition, evaluation and
disappointing  operating  results.  Although  revenues once again grew to record
levels,  the  Company  suffered a net loss in 1999,  a reversal  from the record
earnings  achieved  in the prior two years.  The loss  resulted  primarily  from
greater than  anticipated  costs and challenges of adapting to the Company's new
manufacturing  facility.  Earnings in the prior two years also included gains on
real estate sales,  whereas there were no such sales completed  before April 30,
1999, the fiscal year-end.  The Construction  Segment once again achieved record
revenues and profits. Real Estate operating earnings,  exclusive of asset sales,
and cash flow from owned properties  surged to record levels.  Fiscal 1999 ended
with strong earnings in the fourth quarter.

         For the full fiscal year, consolidated revenues were $188,971,527, 5.8%
above last year's  $178,590,842.  The net loss was $676,031,  or $.23 per share,
compared  to  earnings  in 1998 of  $2,999,478,  or $1.02 per  share.  Per share
figures are based on weighted  average shares  outstanding  of 2,936,356  during
1999 and 2,937,712 during 1998.

OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES BEGAN IN 1925. ABRAMS CONSTRUCTION, INC. OPERATES AS
A GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOCUSING ON BUILDING AND RENOVATING RETAIL STORES, SHOPPING
CENTERS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES,
OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION.

     In an increasingly  competitive  construction  marketplace,  we are pleased
that we were able to achieve record levels of revenues and profits. Construction
revenues grew 9.5% in 1999,  increasing to $160,611,412  from  $146,618,878 last
year.  Gross  profit  increased  by 8.1% to  $8,670,331  in  1999,  compared  to
$8,022,630 in 1998.  Operating  earnings rose at an even faster pace,  expanding
16.5% to $4,084,633 from the year earlier $3,506,217.

     We increased volume with our existing customers,  including Academy Sports,
Borders,  CompUSA,  Garden Ridge,  Kmart,  NationsBank,  Office  Depot,  Service
Merchandise,  Staples,  Stein Mart,  SunTrust  Bank,  The Home  Depot,  Upton's,
Wal-Mart and Ward's. We also built projects for several new customers, including
Bassett,  Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, Mars Music,  Pamida and Urban Retail.
Our broadened  customer base allows us more flexibility  when individual  retail
customers modify growth strategies or change store renovation plans.

     In 1999 we completed  113 projects in 25 states,  striving  throughout  the
year to maintain our reputation of delivering completed projects on schedule.

     Operating   earnings  grew  faster  than   revenues,   the  result  of  our
effectiveness  in employing  our resources  and people  despite  ever-increasing
competitive  forces and a very tight labor  market.  We have been  successful in
retaining an  outstanding  workforce,  adding new  employees  that meet our high
standards of professionalism  and integrity,  while continuing the atmosphere of
trust and teamwork that pervades our Company.

     We acquired new computer  hardware and  software,  as we converted to a new
accounting   system,   and  we  began  the   implementation  of  a  new  project
administration  system. Our ongoing  investments in technology are necessary for
us to continue to increase our effectiveness and efficiency.

     As we enter the new  millennium  we will  endeavor to continue  meeting the
challenge of  profitably  managing  scarce  resources and people while adding to
shareholder value.

OUR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS BEGAN IN 1946. ABRAMS FIXTURE CORPORATION PRODUCES
AND INSTALLS STORE FIXTURES FOR SEVERAL OF THE NATION'S  LEADING  RETAILERS.  IN
ADDITION,  WE  PRODUCE  AND  INSTALL  DISPLAYS  FOR THE  BANKING  INDUSTRY.  ALL
MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS  WERE RELOCATED TO ABRAMS  RIVERSIDE,  OUR NEW 250,000
SQUARE FOOT MANUFACTURING  FACILITY IN LITHIA SPRINGS,  GEORGIA, IN EARLY FISCAL
1999.

     Relocating  any  operating  business is a  challenging  task.  In 1999,  we
actually   relocated  two,  combining  our  formerly  separate  wood  and  metal
operations  in a  unified  manufacturing  facility,  and it  proved to be a much
larger and more costly task than we anticipated. Leaving our two long-time homes
in downtown Atlanta, we moved into our new state-of-the-art facility in suburban
metro-Atlanta  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  1999.  We were not
productively  "settled"  into  operations,  however,  until well into the fourth
fiscal quarter.

     During  the first  two  fiscal  months,  prior to  completion  of the move,
customer  orders  were at very low  levels,  allowing us to focus on packing and
scheduling.  Immediately after we went on-line in the new plant,  however,  with
many unopened "boxes" still lining  production  areas, the volume of orders from
existing customers accelerated  dramatically.  As volume soared, we continued to
meet customer  demand,  including  commencing work on a long-delayed  order, but
many planned  refinements and  modifications  of plant layout were delayed,  and
production  workflow  could not be optimally  scheduled.  Despite steady volume,
numerous  operating  inefficiencies  throughout much of the first three quarters
led to  excessive  labor and  material  costs,  much lower  gross  margins,  and
disappointing operating losses.

     Through the first three quarters of the year,  Abrams  Fixture  Corporation
incurred an operating  loss of just under $2.4 million.  In the fourth  quarter,
however, we achieved operating earnings of $605,702, which reduced the operating
loss for the entire year to $1,760,238. Total annual revenues increased 13.7% to
$17,271,657   from  last  year's   $15,193,653.   Exclusive  of  revenues   from
installation  services,  revenues  from fixture  sales in 1999  actually grew to
$16,100,608,  20.5% above 1998's  $13,364,357.  Because of  increased  labor and
overhead costs in 1999, gross  manufacturing  margin was 15.7%,  slightly better
than half the prior year's 29.2%. By the end of fiscal 1999, however,  the gross
margin showed some improvement.

     We are improving the level of production  completions  without  sacrificing
product  quality.  The new plant has reduced  inefficient  and costly  inventory
handling  through the  elimination of trucking  between  separate metal and wood
shop locations.

     Revenues  in  1999  came  from a  number  of  existing  fixture  customers,
including Aaron Rents, Domino's, John Ryan (NationsBank), Kmart, Sears, Simmons,
Stein Mart,  Stiffel,  Sutton,  The Athlete's Foot Group and The Home Depot. New
customers  included Bassett,  Best Buy, Shaw Industries and U.S. Vision.

     In an effort to address the  decline in our gross  margins,  management  is
focusing on more efficient plant utilization,  optimizing production scheduling,
more  proficient  purchasing,  continuous  employee  training,  and  controlling
overhead  and  expenses.   We  are  directing  marketing  efforts  toward  those
opportunities that best can leverage our high  capacity/high  quality production
capability, as we endeavor to return to profitability.

     OUR REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES BEGAN IN 1960. ABRAMS  PROPERTIES,  INC. ENGAGES
IN  REAL  ESTATE  DEVELOPMENT,  REDEVELOPMENT,   ACQUISITION,  DISPOSITION,  AND
MANAGEMENT OF INCOME-PRODUCING  PROPERTIES,  PRIMARILY SHOPPING CENTERS, AS WELL
AS OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY ACQUIRES OR DEVELOPS PROPERTIES
FOR SALE TO  OTHERS  AND FOR OUR OWN  INVESTMENT  PURPOSES.  ABRAMS  PROPERTIES'
PORTFOLIO  OF   INCOME-PRODUCING   PROPERTIES  ON  APRIL  30,  1999,   CONTAINED
APPROXIMATELY  2.3 MILLION  SQUARE FEET,  IN NINE STATES,  CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN
RETAIL PROPERTIES, TWO OFFICE PROPERTIES AND ONE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY.

     After  several  years  of  strategic  repositioning  through  acquisitions,
dispositions and re-developments, 1999 was devoted to integrating the properties
into our real estate portfolio.  The pause in transactions allowed management to
focus on improving portfolio productivity. The results are  encouraging.

     Cash flow  after  debt  service  from owned  properties  in 1999  increased
$793,000 or 64% over last year, and was 109% higher than the levels of 1995, the
final year before we began the overhaul of the portfolio.  Similarly,  operating
earnings excluding real estate sales and depreciation  surged $1,459,000 or 396%
in 1999, and was $891,000 or 95% above 1995. The return on average cash invested
in real estate tripled in 1999 to 15.06%.

     A key component of our  strategy in recent years has been to use  strategic
sales,  reinvestments and  redevelopments to help diversify the mix of portfolio
revenues and reduce reliance on any single customer. The percentage of portfolio
revenues (total revenues less interest income and gains on sale)  represented by
Kmart,  our largest source of rental  revenue,  was 36% in 1999, a 20% reduction
from last year's figure of 45%, and 36% below 1997's Kmart revenue concentration
of 56%.

     During the year  Merchants  Crossing  Shopping  Center of Newnan,  Georgia,
originally  developed by the Company in 1974 and expanded in 1987 and 1989,  was
marketed  for sale.  Before a sale  transaction  could be  structured,  however,
Goody's  elected to end its  anchor  tenancy  in the  center,  creating a 24,986
square foot vacancy.  While continuing efforts to sell the center, we identified
a suitable  replacement anchor tenant to fill the space. In the closing weeks of
the year, we successfully executed a new lease with Hastings Entertainment, Inc.
Subsequently,  in the first weeks of fiscal 2000, the Company closed on the sale
of the Newnan center for a price of $6.74 million, earning a gross profit on the
sale of $2.9 million.

     In continuation of our strategy to vary the mix of real estate assets,  and
to defer the income tax  otherwise  payable on the gain on sale, in July 1999 we
reinvested  the  proceeds  from the Newnan sale in the  purchase  of  Crossroads
Square Shopping Center in Jacksonville, Florida.

     Effective leasing and a reduction in overall operating costs contributed to
the gains in operating cash flow and operating earnings. Additional increases in
productivity can be achieved by more leasing, effective property management, and
additional cost reductions.

     The  successful  implementation  of our strategic plan is the result of the
leadership,   talents  and  efforts  of  our  team  of  top-notch   real  estate
professionals.  One such executive,  Brennon E. Smith,  Assistant Vice President
and Director of Construction,  earned a promotion to Vice President. We continue
to seek to improve the abilities and productivity of our people.

     As an  additional  vehicle  to grow Real  Estate  cash  flow and  return on
assets,  and in order to expand the  productivity of the Company's cash invested
in real estate, the Company is considering opportunities to work with sources of
outside equity capital.  We continue to seek  diversification  and will look for
other  ways to  improve  investment  returns  as part of our  pursuit  of higher
shareholder value.

     In June 1999, your Board of Directors  declared a dividend in the amount of
$.04 per share, the Company's 80th consecutive quarterly dividend.  The dividend
was paid on June 30, 1999, to shareholders of record as of June 16, 1999.

     The Board of Directors  also decided to commence an in-depth  investigation
of  strategic  and  financial  alternatives  that may be  available  to maximize
shareholder value. That investigation is now underway.

     In July 1999,  Alan R. Abrams,  Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors,  was
promoted to the post of Chief Executive  Officer.  Mr. Abrams succeeds Joseph H.
Rubin,  who is leaving  after  twenty  years of service to the Company to pursue
other  business  interests.  J.  Andrew  Abrams,  Co-Chairman  of the  Board  of
Directors,  became  President and Chief  Operating  Officer,  while remaining as
Chief Executive Officer of the Manufacturing Segment.

     As brothers, we represent the third generation of the Abrams family to lead
our  Company.  We are  honored and proud to continue  our 74-year  tradition  of
creating value for you, the shareholders.


     SINCERELY,
