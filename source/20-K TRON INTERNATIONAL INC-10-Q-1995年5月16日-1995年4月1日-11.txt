1.   Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
     accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of
     the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
     principles for complete financial statements.  The consolidated financial
     statements include the accounts of K-Tron International, Inc. (the
     "Company") and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been
     eliminated in consolidation.  In the opinion of management, all
     adjustments (consisting of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary
     for a fair presentation of results for interim periods have been made.
     The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
     results for a full year.

     The unaudited financial statements herein should be read in conjunction
     with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
     31, 1994 which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
     Commission.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 1, 1995

Financial Condition

     As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1994, the Company is in default under several financial
covenants contained in its loan agreement with three U.S. banks.  These
defaults are continuing and have not been waived.  However, on April 28, 1995,
the Company entered into a forbearance agreement with its U.S. banks in which
they agreed to forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the
loan documents through the earlier of July 31, 1995 or the occurrence of a new
event of default thereunder.  The forbearance agreement also modified the
existing loan documents in certain aspects, including the granting of
additional collateral.  At April 1, 1995, the principal amount outstanding 
under the Company's U.S. loan agreement was $13,628,000.

     The Company is seeking alternative debt or equity financing and has
retained two investment banking firms (Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. and Berwind
Financial Group, Inc.) to assist in these efforts and in the evaluation and
possible implementation of other possible courses of action.  At this time, the
Company has not obtained the commitments needed to replace the U.S. banks, and
its ability to continue as a going concern depends on the future availability
of its existing U.S. credit facility or a replacement line of credit or the
raising of cash through the sale of assets or additional equity.  If the
Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, it may be unable to meet its
obligations in a timely manner, making it necessary to undertake such other
actions as may be appropriate to preserve asset values.

     K-Tron is an international company with more than 70 percent of its
business arising from sources outside the United States, primarily in
Europe, and Germany has become the Company's largest single market as measured
by the Company's revenues.  As such, the financial position and performance of
the Company is sensitive to both translation and transaction fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates.

Results of Operations

           In the first quarter of 1995, the Company reported a net loss of
$1,280,000.  Profit margins were negatively affected by heavily discounted
orders booked in 1994 and the inability to pass on increased material costs
caused by the appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers in other European
countries, costs related to the forebearance agreement and costs related to the
Company's efforts to arrange new financing or sell assets.  First quarter 1995 
results at the Company's German subsidiary, Colortronic, have improved.

     The following table sets forth the Company's results of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:

*At April 1, 1995 foreign exchange translation rates

     Translation of the Company's foreign revenues and results of operations
into U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates,
particularly with respect to the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark.  Revenues
and earnings in the first quarter of 1995 were affected by changes in the
average U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate, which increased 17% to $.806 per
Swiss franc in the first quarter of 1995 from $.690 in the same period of 1994,
and by a change in the U.S. dollar/Deutsche mark exchange rate, which increased
16% to $.677 per Deutsche mark in the first quarter of 1995 from $.582 for the
same period in 1994.

     Total revenues increased by $8.6 million or 39% ($5.5 million or 25% when
using a constant foreign exchange rate) in the first quarter of 1995 versus the
same period in 1994.  Total revenues increased due to the strong European and
United States year end 1994 backlog, and the effect of a weaker U.S. dollar
relative to the Swiss franc and Deutsche mark.

     Gross margin as a percent of revenues declined to 36.7% in the first
quarter of 1995 as compared to 40.6% for the same period in 1994.  The decline
in the first quarter 1995 margin was primarily due to heavily discounted orders
booked in 1994, as well as the inability to pass on increased material costs
caused by the appreciation of the Swiss franc to customers in other European
countries.

     Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased by $2.6
million, or 33.8% in the first quarter of 1995 as compared to the same period
in 1994.   The increase was primarily due to higher foreign exchange
translation rates, commissions and selling expenses related to the increased
sales volume.  In addition, the Company incurred costs related to the 
forebearance agreement and costs related to the Company's efforts to arrange 
new financing or sell assets.  As a percent of revenues, SG&A was 33.4% in 
1995 and 34.8% in 1994.  The decrease in SG&A as a percent of revenues in 
1995 was primarily due to the increase in revenues.
<PAGE>   10
     Research and development (R&D) expenditures in the first quarter of 1995
decreased $.1 million as compared to the same period in 1994 due to synergies
realized from the integration of the Company's brands, offset in part by the
higher foreign exchange translation rate.  R&D expense as a percent of revenues
was 3.2% in 1995 and 4.8% in 1994.  The decrease in R&D as a percent of
revenues in 1995 was primarily due to the increase in revenues.

     Interest expense as a percent of revenues increased in the first quarter
of 1995 primarily due to increased European borrowings and higher interest
rates in the United States offset in part by reduced interest rates in Europe.

     The Company did not have any income tax expense due to the losses incurred.

     The backlog of orders increased at the end of the first quarter of 1995 by
47% as compared to the same period in 1994 primarily due to the European
recovery from recession and strong bookings in the United States.

     Increased selling prices and reduced production and distribution costs
should improve future margins, and the Company's objective continues to be to
return to profitability later in 1995.

</TABLE>

     Total debt increased since year end 1994 by $8,283,000 of which
$6,896,000 was due to the effect of foreign exchange translation.  Total debt
without the effect of the foreign exchange translation increased by $1,387,000.
European debt increased by $2,064,000 while U.S. debt decreased $677,000.  The
Company had available $1,190,000 of unused long and short-term credit
facilities as of April 1, 1995.
<PAGE>   11
     At the end of the first quarter of 1995 and year end 1994, working
capital was ($318,000) and ($549,000) respectively and the ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was .99 to 1.0.

     Cash used in 1995 operating activities was $859,000.  The decline in
operating cash flow was primarily the result of the increase in inventories
needed to support the increase in backlog.

     Cash used in financing activities in 1995 was primarily the result of
changes required to support working capital needs.

     Changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly with respect to the
Swiss franc and Deutsche mark, caused a translation adjustment increase in
shareholders' equity of $1,069,000 in the first quarter of 1995.

                 4.6          No Additional Debt.  No Obligor shall incur

<PAGE>   13
income tax returns on a consolidated basis and they are entitled to a federal
income tax refund for the year ending December 31, 1994 of approximately
$442,000 (of which they received approximately $42,000 in February, 1995). On
or before the date of this Agreement, the Obligors shall assign all income tax
refunds payable from any governmental body or agency to FFB, for itself and as
Agent for the Banks.  Should any Obligor determine that it is entitled to an
income tax refund at any time during the Forbearance Period or thereafter until
the Obligations are satisfied, it shall notify the Agent of its intent to file
a tax return requesting such refund at least one week before filing such a
return so that the assignment of its income tax refund (and any other necessary
or appropriate papers) may be attached to such tax return prior to the filing
thereof.  The Obligors shall deliver to the Agent, immediately upon receipt
thereof, any payment received (with any necessary endorsement) pursuant to an
income tax refund to be applied to reduce the Obligations; and prior to
delivery thereof to the Agent, any such income tax refund shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks.

                 4.12         Financial Information; Tax Returns.  Upon the
filing of any document with the Securities Exchange Commission or any tax
return or quarterly tax filing with any governmental agency, authority or body,
the Obligors shall simultaneously deliver to the Agent and the Banks copies of
such documents, returns or filings.

                 4.13         Accounts Receivable from Foreign Affiliates.
K-Tron America and K-Tron International (i) represent and warrant to the Banks
that their net aggregate accounts receivable due from any and all of their
foreign Affiliates was $736,000 as of March 3, 1995, (ii) agree that they shall
cause their foreign Affiliates to pay to the Borrowers within 30 days of the
end of each fiscal month, the amount of any net incremental aggregate accounts
receivable in excess of $736,000 due from the Borrowers' foreign Affiliates as
of the end of such fiscal month (and to the extent that such excess accounts
receivable is not paid by the foreign Affiliates within such 30 day period,
then within such 30 day period, the Borrowers shall pay the amount of such
excess to the Agent for the benefit of the Banks to be applied to the
Obligations); provided, however, that if payment by Colortronic GmbH of its
share of such excess accounts receivable would cause a violation of Colortronic
GmbH's loan agreements, then the payment of an amount not to exceed $150,000 of
such excess accounts receivable due from Colortronic GmbH may be deferred by
Colortronic GmbH (and the Borrowers) for an additional 60 days, (iii) agree
that any amounts that may hereafter become due from K-Tron America and/or
K-Tron International to their foreign Affiliates shall be netted (i.e. setoff)
against such accounts receivable, and (iv) agree that they shall deliver to the
Agent for the benefit of the Banks, to be applied to Obligations, an amount
equal to any reduction in such net accounts receivable from foreign Affiliates
as of the end of each month below $736,000 less any prior amounts paid pursuant
to this clause (iv)





                                     - 13 -

(but not more than $736,000 in the aggregate) within 30 days of the end of such
month.

                 4.14         Third Party Accounts Payable.  Third party
accounts payable of K-Tron America shall not exceed more than $4.0 million.
For purposes of this section, any commissions that are not paid when due shall
be included in K-Tron America's accounts payable.

                 4.15         No Payments to Affiliates Without Fair
Consideration.  No Obligor shall make any payments or transfers to any of its
Affiliates unless fair and reasonable consideration is received therefor and
such Affiliate is not liable to such Obligor for any accounts receivable or
other amounts due to such Obligor.

                 4.16         Liability for Corporate Overhead.  K-Tron America
shall not be liable to K-Tron International for more than its proportionate
share of corporate expenses based upon K-Tron International's Corporate Expense
Budget for 1995 which shall be subject to review of the Banks as provided in
Section 6.2 hereof.  K-Tron International shall use its best efforts to cause
its European Affiliates to pay their share of monthly corporate expenses
(including all management fees) each month within 30 days of the end of each
month.  K-Tron America shall not pay more than its fair share of K-Tron
International's research and development and marketing international
expenditures on an interim and annual basis; and in any event K-Tron America
shall not pay more than $1,400,000 for research and development and marketing
international expenditures in the fiscal year ending 1995.  Within 25 days of
the end of each calendar quarter, K-Tron America shall provide to the Banks a
report of its year to date and quarterly research and development and marketing
international expenditures.

                 4.17         Inventory Purchases.  K-Tron America shall not
purchase more inventory than is reasonably required to fill orders that have
been accepted or budgeted in the Forecast or purchase inventory from any
Affiliate for a price that is higher than prices for comparable products
supplied by entities that are not Affiliates.

                 4.18         Deposit Accounts.  The Obligors shall maintain
all of their deposit and other accounts at FFB.

                 4.19         Execution of Other Documents.  At the Agent's
request, the Obligors shall execute and deliver to the Agent such other
documents and agreements which the Agent, in its sole and reasonable
discretion, deems necessary or convenient to carry out the terms of this
Forbearance Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
